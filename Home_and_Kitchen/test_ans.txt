they 're made of silicone , not sure about if they 're `` professional grade '' but we havent had any problems with them . 
it says bpa free in the descriptor , but i have not double checked them . 
none that i know of . we constantly refill and freeze 
no need for square glasses . most on the rocks glasses work fine . 
yes , but they rinse out easily . 
you have to keep shaking it , eventually the whipped cream will separate into butter and whey . 
yes . i freeze butter all the time and my homemade stuff is no different . works great . 
i have no clue what cultured butter is . 
i do n't know for sure but i do n't think so . to make butter using buttercup it is best to use the freshest butter you can get and make sure the temperature of the cream is at the room temperature . 
no , we bought our own jars to store the butter in . 
well , it is a popcorn popper ... ..i would n't expect it to roast beans ... 
no there is no switch . you have to plug it in and it automatically turns on . to turn it off you have to unplug it . 
no . you can melt butter in tray scoop at the top but you still must dump it after you are finished popping the popcorn . 
hello , this popper is made in china . thank you .

yes ! just follow instructions with it ! 
the winds of the internet seem to point to part 5300622034 for your dryer . part 5300622032 ( the one you are inquiring about ) has 1 4 '' terminals whereas the part ending in `` 34 '' has 5 16 '' terminals . granted i 'm not a parts guy . you may want to put in a call to your local appliance repair center to verify part and prices , if no one else replies . 
i have a fridgidaire dryer and it worked fin in that . i would suggest getting a fuse too . i blew mine after i replaced the coil . it 's cheap and easy as well , but you might as well do them at the same time . 
it works on any electrical dryers in us 
element rated at 5200 watts 
yes ... .just have to take it apart . 
yes this works on all electric dryers when installed proberly 
yes it 's ok si esa pieza si me sirvi , soy tcnico en appliances y la utilizo regularmente , tanks for askme 
this humidifier uses a wick so i would think not 
no . it only does it if you 're blasting the a c to the max for a while , then it might fog up a bit . but it 's not really all that powerful . it 's still pretty effective as a humidifier , just not as effective as a full sized one by any means . 
not really sure . i usually use the intermittant setting . i drive about 40 minutes each way to work 5 days a week , and it lasts a month or so that way . 
cool must only 
it plugs into the car cigarette lighter and provides a mist that is continuous . do n't think ultrasonic , but the mist is quite fine . it can plug into an outlit that fits usb . i like it . 
yes 
hi theresa , the direction comes with it ... if yours does not have it for whatever reason , please email info @ canaryproducts.com , and they will email you one right away . best wishes , 
the trundle fits a conventional twin mattress but must be 6-7 '' thick max . thank you for allowing me to assist you - from the # 1 discovery world furniture seller on amazon - dreamscape furniture : ) feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you need further assistance . scott 
mostly by yourself but will need someone to hold up or balance a couple of parts . my 10 year old was able to assist . 
good morning sergio - yes there is a white twin over twin listed by dreamscape as well . the listing is http : www.amazon.com gp product b00fyvgkou . this one is for the drawer option and there is another one for the trundle option . thank you for allowing me to assist you - from the # 1 discovery world furniture seller on amazon - dreamscape furniture : ) feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you need further assistance . scott 
hello yosora - hello - i am not able to give you the weight capacity but can tell you the bed has met all the astm safety requirements for weight capacity . my understanding is the bed is tested with 400 pounds for a short period of time . this does not mean you should put 400 pounds on the bed . in general , beds that meet the astm safety guidelines have a recommendation of about 200 pounds of distributed weight per sleeping surface . of course this will depend on many factors such as kids being kids and jumping up and down in one concentrated area or the thickness and quality of the mattress . thank you for allowing me to assist you - from the # 1 discovery world furniture seller on amazon - dreamscape furniture : ) feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you need further assistance . scott 
hello john - yes there is another listing with the drawers . if you can not locate it i can send you the listing number tomorrow morning when the office opens again . let me know . scott 
good day - the dimensions of the bed in twin size are 41 '' deep x 98 '' widex 64 '' high . in full size it becomes 57 '' deep . thank you for allowing me to assist you - from the # 1 discovery world furniture seller on amazon - dreamscape furniture : ) feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you need further assistance . scott 
the caddy is about 22 '' wide and 10 '' tall . it has three straps 2 '' wide , which just come off the top edge of it . they 're 13 '' long with 8 '' of velcro . the other half of the velcro is on the back of the caddy itself , so the straps wrap all the way around the sideboard and velcro back onto the caddy . see the third picture in the listing . 
no , it wo n't fit around a sideboard of a bed unless you are talking less than total 8 inches . works ok on a bunk rail as shown but you ca n't put much weight in it . would not purchase it again . 
yes . just released in march . 
accrding to my bathroom scales it weighs just under 17 lbs 
the dyson dc65 animal complete . i have the first dyson vac ever made and still love it but i was visiting a friend and they had the newer one with the ball . what a difference , so easy to maneuver . since i have two cats i decided to get the new dc65 . it is great , pics up hair like nothing and the attachments are great for upholstery . we keep the original one upstairs and use the new one downstairs . no more carrying the vac up and down the stairs . 
no it is a light machine . my wife loves it . she has back issues so it was important to find a great machine like this . 
this question made me curious , i was n't sure so i got the dyson out of the closet and weighed it on my bathroom scale . with an empty dirt canister and the cord wound it came in at 15.5 lbs . fyi , i 'm 70 years old and i can honestly tell you that this is the easiest to use and most efficient vacuum i 've ever used . it 's not a lightweight but the ball makes it so agile that i do n't have any problem with the weight . 
i have n't noticed any marks , but i have a low nap carpet ... 
yes . the actual device is identical . 
china 
this model has 2 controllers and , therefore , that have 2 separate outlets . 
have you covered your blanket with a another blanket ? that will cause it to flash an error message and shut off 
the scord from the bottom of the blanket to the control is about 10 feet the power cord from the controller to the outlet is about five and a half feet 
no they can not smell it because your container is closed . i 've tried many containers inside the unit . currently i use a glass container inside . it works wonders ! try pyrex with a lid or my favorite is a glass container from the container store . p.s . i had cabbage today . no smell at work . 
i have never `` cooked '' anything , only heat precooked meals . the best meals are those that are moist since the heat is distributed better . i imagine one could actually cook with the hot logic or even steam veggies with a bit of water added . 
i 've used a variety of frozen entrees , and how long they take to heat up depends upon the thickness of the tray . heating occurs by means of a hot plate at the bottom , so i would say the more contact you have with the hotplate the better . a typical frozen entre takes around an hour to an hour and a half to get hot all through . your food wo n't `` cook '' ; it should be already cooked ; but it will get quite hot . aluminum is a good conductor of heat , and since burritos are round and would n't make good contact , i 'd suggest wrapping the burrito in aluminum foil , and at the same time , see if you can find an aluminum tray with sides on it that will fit the burrito as closely as possible . maybe one that would be used to bake a small loaf of bread . that way , the sides will get as hot as the bottom where the hotplate is and with the foil on wrapped around it , the heating process will be much quicker . 
only the bottom is hard the rest is a soft material . you can store it in a smaller space . 
no 
according to the instructions , leave the plastic on and do not pierce , i.e. , do not poke holes in the plastic . hotlogic works best when the seal remains intact . 
no 
i 'm not familiar with `` microwave safe '' products but i 'm fairly certain that the hotlogic will not set anything on fire . the worst it 's done for me is bake rice crusty onto the sides of my glass pyrex container . do n't know if that means it will melt anything . 
in my experience they last around 3 hours , which is less than duraflame but , they definitely put off more heat . in my opinion , getting more heat and a good non-smokey smell is a great trade-off for one less hour of burn time . 
there are six in the box . 
it depends if you 're putting it in a fireplace or if you 're bringing it outside and a fire pit i burned 1 to 2 and a fireplace in the house and the same thing outside it is recommended only to use one at a time 
yes 
it is made of bonded leather . thank you ! 
yes 
i 'm pretty sure it 's 30 '' x30 '' . check the product details i 'm pretty sure it says the size . 
no very good quality 
i dont know but its very nice good quality and u can store alot in the inside 
30.5 square 14 inches tall . 
that 's not normal . orders should be processed , at most , 8 business days , depending on the type of item . in rare cases , if the item needs to be manufactured after the order has been placed , it may take about 10-15 business days . however , most items are ready to ship from the factory warehouse within 1-2 business days , unless you purchased from an international merchant . please check with the merchant and find out where they are located , and why your item still has n't been shipped . 
yes you can we use them for coffee all the time , never had one break . 
hi , this item does not come with lids . thank you , lily 's home customer service 
does n't come with lids , but they would take regular size lids . 
16 ounces 
they are about 5 inches tall , 3 inches wide ( without handle ) , and hold about 16 ounces of liquid . the 5 inches includes the top rim . 
i 'm not sure but it 's the size of your average mason jar . 
i do n't know but it looks strong . 
16oz . 
i think they were made in china ... package in ny ... very nice glasses tho , thick and they have some weight to them . i really like mine ... i do n't regret buying them ! 
in the `` product details '' section it said 34.5 x 1 x 22.8 inches ; 3 pounds 
our mats are flexible but strong enough to hold 3 gallons of water without the mat losing its form . the mat is made of an eco-friendly low destiny polyethylene . 
my under sink plumbing was rather low and worried me if the tray would work but it did . fit perfect ! no adjustments needed . if your pipes come up from the floor then you can easily drill thru this material . just make sure your width and depth measurements are correct . i love this product . hope this helps . 
yes 
yes , the mat size is 33 '' 3 8 x 21 '' 5 8 x 1 '' . the mat is flexible enough so if the dimension is off a little bit , it 's still okay . 
yes , it will fit . you 'll have to get creative to get it in around the center support , but i have one and too and i was able to get it situated . 
probably not . the mat is fairly rigid , so i do n't think you 'll have much leeway . however , its rigidity is its saving grace , in that it will stand up well to contain any spill that you have . the edges wo n't flop over and leak anything out . it has saved my posterior many times in the short time i 've had it . 
several hours , not meant for whole home cleaning 
i have no idea ... it 's a totally rechargeable battery so i do n't think you ever need to remove it . 
yes it does ! ! 
yes . two settings . one for floor and another for carpet 
you can purchase a new rechargable battery through amazon . as for replacement parts they can be purchased from shark at very high prices . groupon recently offered a reconditioned unit . it is best to purchase a new unit . 
yes 
the thermos is 9 and 5 8 inches tall and 2 and 3 4 inches in diameter . it works well . 
i 've washed ours in the dishwasher several times and have had no problems with it . so i 'd say yes . 
yes . 9 and 1 2 inches circum or 2 and 2 3 inches across bottom . almost 10 inches high , including cup . 
it does n't , i returned the one i purchased . 
2-5 business days and just reply to this email for the name . i also offer 2 priority mail 
on the amazon web site you would go to `` your orders '' then click on your order and there should be a link for contact seller . 
the best way that works for me is to place in freezer for 1 minute and handle carefully when removing backing but it should pop right off . since different types of frosting may be used by different sellers you may want to contact the seller you purchased from . 
9 x 13 
yes just send me another message with order number and details of what you want 
use a regular microwave cooker , as you would for veggies . the potato express is n't worth your time or money . 
no , you do n't cut or puncture the potato . just rinse it off and place it into the potato cover . there are instructions with the potato cover . 
no 
no . you really do n't need a recipe . just microwave the potatoes in the glove . they come out just like baked potatoes but in a much shorter time . potatoes can be microwaved without the glove but the product is less moist . be sure to turn over as they direct , half way thru the cook time . 
no , they are much lighter as compared to stoneware . i think they compare in weight to the average bone china . 
no 
there is a pastabowl not shown . i bought this a few weeks ago and i love it ! it 's so beautiful . 
no , the opal innocence carved porcelain dinnerware in made in china . 
sure . it has a flat bottom . 
none to my knowledge 
yes - but the tv has to have a standard vesa style mount ( either the larger one or the smaller ) . you are likely able to find a smaller ( cheaper ) stand for such a small tv . we use this mounted to a 52 '' widescreen that move all around the building . it 's great . 
yes , it will hold a monitor up to 100 pounds ... it is very sturdy and well built : ) 
i honestly do n't know . we have it set up as a landscape and you can move it up and down or tilt . when i had a question about putting it together i called the manufacturer and they were able to answer my questions . i would call customer service . 
yes it is dishwasher safe . 
i do n't know anything about the nordic ware product . however , i can tell you this much : these silicone sheets are very easy to cut with a scissors . if you are concerned these silicone sheets may be too small , there are many larger ones for sale on amazon . just buy a larger one , cut it down , and either save the unused portion , or use it for another tray . 
no , i went and checked the package and it dose not have where they were made . i do know that they work great and we use them often . 
no 
works well on vinyl . 
yes you can i have been since i got mine love it 
i am not sure , but if you have not purchased the steamer yet , i would not . i liked the shark one i had a lot better . sorry i could not help on the pad question . 
maybe 2-3 lbs . 
i would call electrolux , my steamer is in the shop right now . it was not getting hot enough , & electrolux had me bring it to a repair shop . maybe they can help you ? 
about 15min . wet the mop before you start that will save some running time 
i read it did that the first couple uses . mine was used and never has . 
yes it will automatically shut off after it 's finished cooking . 
yes it does . 
two at a time . the hard boiled ones are the best . so easy ! ! i am happy with this product ... 
yes the manufacturer states it is bpa free . 
yes . you just plug it in . i use it five or so times per week . great well priced product . 
no there is n't . just set a mental timer for 10 minutes . for the money ... this egg cooker is really fantastic ! 
it states on the bottom label that it conforms to ul std 1026. hope that helps you . 
it holds 8 cups 
just to make sure . spray a lil bit of pam . would be enough ! great product ! ! ! 
i have n't tried but i do n't see why not . it 's pretty sturdy 
i just hand washed it . 
it holds 8 cups . 
it 's about 8 inches across , and maybe 5 inches high . these are just guesses . 
yes , so far as i know all silicone bakeware is microwave safe . 
3 
the cookware is made from stainless steel , aluminum , glass , and a 4.5 millimeter magnetized stainless steel plate base to ensure even heat distribution with no hotspots on the cooking surface . the inside is made up of stone . 
yes the cookware can be used on induction stovetops . 
manufacturer recommends hand washing . 
no not china . i believe they are made in germany . 
i have an entire set and find no restrictions with my use . 
no must use nonmetal 
no . but best pots in the world in my opinion 
hello . none of our items are coated in teflon . the inside are coated in stone , creating the unique non stick . 
you can i think but i have a frame that serves as the box spring as well . 
phyllis , the bed is pretty stiff , i do n't think it would work in an adjustable bed frame . my partner weights 205 lbs and his side of the bed has starting to show some indentations and the bed is not even , we bought the mattress july 2014. i think we should have gotten the more expensive one . we are planning to buy another one . 
that 's difficult to answer , since that 's a everyone 's anatomy responds differently . that said , i think it 's quite firm . not hard , but i never sink down into it . i do n't sleep on my stomach due to neck and back issues , so i ca n't say with any confidence when it would be like . but soft is not the way i would describe this bad . 
a little cornmeal under the pizza will keep it from sticking ... and add flavor to the pizza.. 
i have n't done that , but it may work if you prepare your crust on parchment and slide the whole thing on your pizzeria . i make my crusts on parchment and they cook perfectly and are easy to put on and take off . heating on 3 and cooking on 1 has also worked best for me . let us know how it works for you . 
yes , but you must watch closely . it heats up quickly . 
plates and bowls are made in usa . 
yes ! 
i eat a lot of tomato and curry based foods on my plates , as a well as a lot of soy sauce base food and they 're just as pristine white as when they came out of the box . i love corelle . 
it depends on the situation . in a sealed container with no extra source of moisture , indefinitely . in my incredibly damp garage about 30 minutes . they can be `` reactivated '' by baking in the oven and i have been experimenting with using low power settings in the microwave with some success . ( full power causes them to `` snap , crackle , and pop ) . i also bought some of the little humidity indicator cards so i can monitor the humidity in my containers . 
what you see in the picture is what you get . there is no address for a manufacturer or statement of origin . if it was made in the usa , my guess would be that it would say so . the seller - silicagel factory seems to be a chinese company and they also sell on alibaba . 
you can either guess , or buy some of the little indicator cards that have little patches which turn from blue to pink . 
you 'd have to use a lot of them , preferably in a 'container ' that could be sealed . otherwise there would be no point . these are primarily meant for cameras and other sensitive equipment . i use them for small tools ( in containers ) that could rust . 
yes . i believe the directions are something like 220 for 2 hours . i personally put them into a food dehydrator for 2 hours at 165. i have some other kinds which have indicator crystals so you can tell when they are recharged and i do them all in one batch . so far , 2 hours at 165 seems to work just fine . if you have them in an oven , do keep an eye on them so the paper does n't scorch . 
yes you can . i think you may buy some tots like you buy at home depot-the extra large with yellow lids you cant miss them 12.50 each . place the silica packs about 2 of them on each tote with the books . then use plastic wire ties to tie the lids to the black bottom , 
no it does not . 
china 
sometimes but not always . if it tips the lid fills and does n't drain back down in the bottom so when you take the lid off you get water on you which is a real mess . 
no 
nope , not at all . 
not unless it was a very skinny straw . there are 4 parts , the bottle itself , the main cap , the section that goes inside the bottle for fruit , etc. , which is perforated to allow the water to pass through for the infusion process , and the 'lid ' for that section , which has small , oval holes which sieve the infused water through . the 'lip ' you drink from is thin enough to where there is no 'dribbling ' when you drink . great contraption , i really like mine . 
seller can probably make almost any size . i purchased an 8 gallon 
how many gallons is this still ? 
i called in ovente and they said that it is bpa free . 
yes , the kettle is very easy to clean - just rinse it out if needed ( we are just boiling water in it ) . the only problem after months of use and many pots of water per day at the office , there were some mineral deposits on the bottom of the glass kettle where the heating element is - small round dots along the outer edge . all i needed to do was swish some clr around in the bottom of the kettle and the mineral deposits came right out . 
this was hard to tell because the black plastic covers the bottom outside so you ca n't tell visually . but i drained it and felt around inside ( there are some odd ridges and bumps ) and it all felt like glass . hope this helps . 
no 
i think that you probably could but i 'd send an email to the manufacturer to be sure . 
according to the information on the bottom of the box , they are made in china . 
yup . it sits on a circular base . connects and disconnects very smoothly . its a little slow to boil though . that 's the only bad thing i could say about it though . 
made in china designed in italy 
on the bottom it says `` made in china . '' 
mine operates on 4 `` aa '' not `` d '' cells . 
total height is 32 3 4 inches . i have to add that this trash can came without a dent or a scratch , and it works perfectly . i would buy it again . 
no 
bought for my mom in chicago an she said its to beautiful for garbage 
it will hold a few 1 gallon milk jugs , but the pizza boxes would have to be folded up , if they are for , say , a 16 '' large pie . i burn my cardboard and use half gallon waxed cardboard milk containers , and burn them also . 
the one time i used this , i mixed the batter and then put it in the dispenser . i was making cupcakes -- - and it worked great until the mechanism that allows the dispenser at the bottom to open , broke . i tried to fix it , but evidently i do n't have the expertise . this is a great idea -- just not as sturdy as it might be . 
yes ! ! i wash mine by hand because the dishwasher water tends to pool in one spot . but it only takes a minute ! ! i love mine so much that it 's several people 's christmas gifts this year . 
yes 
thicker cupcake batter did not work , so unless your brownie batter is super thin , i 'd say no . 
i 'm not really sure of the question but if it has to do with the packaging being eco friendly then i can tell you i was very pleased with the way the item was packaged . i hope this was helpful . 
i do n't have anything to measure that exactly but if seems like it about medium-firm in density for both layers . but the top memory foam layer seems like it might be softer than the base layer . when on my side with my elbow straight down pointing into the mattress the ild seems is minimal compared to any spring mattress or couch cushion . 
we already had the box spring from our other mattress . since the measurements were the same , it fit perfectly ! hope that helps ! enjoy ! 
i think this mattress is way too mushy ( and i 'm a lightweight ) 
warranty book inside packaging . 
i got it within a week 
if by `` components '' you mean the bed frame and box ( and possibly all the bedding and pillows ) , we 're reusing the old sleep number bed , and i seriously doubt those pieces are american-made ... it be nice to be able to buy all-american ... 
it is about 3'x4 ' . the chair is in two pieces and the legs are off . the fedex guy carried it up 5 stairs to my door without using a dolly . 
i 've forgotten the industry name for the stuff , but it is 'mostly ' leather , a composite of ground up leather and synthetics which feels , acts , and smells like leather , is sturdy and authentic looking . the chair is attractive , has a nice 'hand ' if you prefer to sit on on leather , and is a bargain . i suspect the frame will loosen up and fail long before the composite leather upholstery wears out . ah , found it in wikipedia , it 's 'bonded leather ' , `` ... the us federal trade commission recommends according to 16 c.f.r . section 24 : `` for example : an industry product made of a composition material consisting of 60 % shredded leather fibers may be described as : bonded leather containing 60 % leather fibers and 40 % non-leather substances . `` [ 7 ] the federal trade commission has said that `` the guidelines caution against misrepresentations about the leather content in products containing ground , reconstituted , or bonded leather , and state that such products , when they appear to be made of leather , should be accompanied by a disclosure as to the percentage of leather or other fiber content . the guidelines also state that these disclosures should be included in any product advertising that might otherwise mislead consumers as to the composition of the product ... '' 
made in china 
something is wrong . may have to send it back . it should lock . 
i would say 17-20 inches . i have the chair in a corner of the room and the top of the chair is 17 '' from the wall . this allows me to fully extend the recliner . 
it is not as tall as some recliners , but quite comfortable ( maybe not nap comfortable ) 
it will fit 1 1 4 '' hose end which the hoover has , it should work . 
do n't have a kirby . it is just a straight insert piece ... no special connectors . sorry i ca n't be more help . 
it fits a standard wand . do other standard attachments fit the animal ? 
sorry , i do n't have a miele canister . i know it fits nicely on my 2.5 gallon shop vac and my mighty mini shop vac hoses . i took a leap of faith that i 'd measured my hose correctly when i ordered this . so if you measure your canister hose and it is the same size , then it will more than likely fit . 
yes 
i do n't know anything about a bissell upright . mine attached to the hose of my vacuum cleaner , and it works great . 
fits inside the hose end nicely , not outside as you would expect it to 
i ca n't say for sure as i do not have a miele canister vacuum cleaner at this house . i have an in wall vacuum system and it works with this type of hose . returning things with amazon could not be easier if it did n't fit . 
induction-compatible cookware contains ferromagnetic materials - in other words , it contains iron , or has a layer with magnetic properties . cast iron , enamel cast iron and most types of stainless steel cookware are all induction compatible , but not all types . aluminum , copper or glass cookware will not work unless they have a layer on the bottom with magnetic properties . to tell if a pot or pan is induction-compatible , hold a magnet to the bottom . if it clings , the cookware will work on an induction cooktop . also , many manufacturers have started putting an `` induction compatible '' symbol on the bottom of their cookware or they 'll note compatibility on their packaging . the symbol often looks like a horizontal zig-zag or a coil .

yes you can use a standard 120 volt 15 amp . outlet 
do not buy them they are made cheap i all ready have rust in ny pan 
i dont know . but i dont recomend you to buy this product ! i bought it and from the very first time i used it the teflon started to fall , so dissapointed 
yes it is ! no worries , put it right in the dishwasher ! 
believe it ceramic they are also thin and not worth the money 
have n't noticed that . like it so much , purchased a second for a vacation home 
yes they are it works great 
no . plastic of some sort . 
it is sea salt which is a coarse but a wonderful salt for cooking . you could possibly try morton iodized salt but you would only need a salt shaker not a grinder for that . 
7-1 3 '' 
yes 
the heat comes out of a small vent on the top 
i will measure and get back to you just email me at ventersorlando @ yahoo.com 
no it is n't . it runs continuously on a high or low setting . 
yes it does . it was supposed to come with the floor stand too , check the fine print with your offer because i did not receive the floor stand and had to contact them to send it to me separately . 
it 's no bigger then a 32 inch fall screen tv and with stand it 's about 2 inches bigger . this is in our family room on top of a wooden dog crate and it 's amazing and every one loves it . we are satisfied . 
not sure of difference , but i love mine . i have a choice of logs or stones in mine . i paid a similar price for another one at costco , but much much smaller . 
there are no marks on these to identify the place they were made , sorry . 
i believe so . i love this set of scoops , i use mine all the time , especially for cookie dough , muffins , cup cakes . pancakes etc . it is a really good set . 
about an inch , maybe a little more 
yes , they are . 
this scale can weigh in fractions of pounds ( 100.2 pounds ) , but not under one pound . if you click on 'smart weigh ' which is a link under the product title , you 'll go to an amazon page that has kitchen scales and other scales that can measure in grams . 
yes , it stays on for about 5 seconds . 
pretty sure they rest under a snap on latch on the under side . personally i do n't care for the accuracy of this scale . should have spent more for a better one . 
no 
flat surface like tile 
the crumb tray slides out the front of the oven . you need to open the door then pull out the tray 
yes - to four different levels . well , there are two slots in each side , but the tray itself has elevated & lowered levels . 
yes

not sure , my box was 60 '' long . might want to ask the company before unpacking ( would be really hard to pack up to ship back ) . 877-955-5503 is their customer service number . 
when i ordered it they sent me tracking numbers , ups . delivered so i could see from the tracking numbers when it would arrive 
no , once it is expanded , it is just like a regular mattress . such a comfortable bed ; - ) 
i would think so ... its very comfortable and i do belive it will be fine on your box spring . 
no 
it does n't . holds its shape ! 
my husband is 6'1 and weighs 285 ? or more and no problem with that . very comfy and a great deal 
hello , most likely you can put 1 and the pillows . thank you 
hello , any household vacuum cleaner will work even the size does not matter as long as it has good suction . all you do is remove the vacuum handle and place the hose on top of the suction cap and turn it on ; it will do the job . thank you 
this is straight from the supplier : please note the duplication . storage army bag sizes : small : 40x60cm medium : 50x70cm xxl : 60x100cm gigantic : 100x80x40cm jumbo : 85x120cm ( the biggest size in the market ) jumbo hanging 120x70cm mega : 100x80x40cm we have 1 set that includes 10pcs mix size : 2x 60x100cm , 3x small 40x60cm , 3x medium 50x70cm , 2x gigantic 100x80x40cm 
no , it is not ! i made the same assumption and found out , after it arrived , that it only came up in search because of the color : `` electric blue . '' god bless 
i bought it for a gift so am not sure ; however , i have not received any complaints . 
no , but it is super soft , and i did my research and amazon has the lowest price for a new dreamfoutain , i also found out with experince that when its cold the blanket will become warm , no joke ! ! ! so it doesnt have temperature settings , but it is very comfortable and afordable & # 128512 ; 
there is no cord . it does n't heat . just a simple throw , but beautiful and warm . 
48 '' x 60 '' ( 4 feet x 5 feet ) 
its quit frim not took soft but comfortable 
i do n't have the exact weight since i got this about a year ago , but it came in two boxes , one about 120 lbs and the second about 80 lbs . 
hello , thanks for your question . according to the information in the product description section of the product page , the left end reclining chaise lounge is included in this set . if you 'd like to confirm this directly with one of the sellers , you can go to their storefront page and click on `` contact the seller '' which you 'll find in the bottom right corner of the page . have a great day ! 
dear vivian g. , thank you for contacting home decorators collection . i will be happy to assist with your inquiry regarding the fabric on the easton breakfast nook . i apologize this informaiton was not available to you . this fabirc is a bonded leather . 
the measurmenet from the floor to the seat is 18 1 2 '' 
more of a tan , off white . no yellow . 
unfortunately , we do not offer any other easton items . 
the measurement is as you are facing the item . 
the pieces are not attached together so you may assemble them in any order you desire . 
i 'm sure there is . it does not come with one but it has plenty of room . 
the desk is 60 inches by 60 inches . the side of the desk with the drawers is 23 1 4 inches deep . the side without drawers is 19 3 4 inches deep . the desk is 29 1 2 inches tall . 
yes on the left hand side . 
hi these items are rta ( ready to assemble ) and flat packed so disassemble could be a little difficult but it can be done 
about 14 '' i suppose . not a bad width , i can swivel my chair and sit comfortably with out feeling cramped by cabinet on that side . this has been a great desk so far , as long as you take the time to use carpenter 's wood glue where all the pegs and screws go together . really solid . 
i do n't think it 's real wood or entirely real wood but it is very solid and sturdy . i have no fears that it will fall apart anytime soon . 
23.25 '' . this desk is amazing ! took a long time to put together but the end result is well worth it . 
yes the seat is attached , it 's one piece . the legs attach to the seat . 
very good size without cushions . as illustrated would make a tight fit with cushions 
in pieces . it took my dad about 45 minutes to put it together . no problems . i really like the chair . remember to get comfy cushions ! 
this are two cushions . 
we have a light beige color of cushion as an option . please , contact us directly and i will send you a picture . thanks 
i think the easiest way to explain it is that each chair is 26 '' wide from arm to arm . you can measure that easily to your table . lovely chairs by the way ! 
my chairs came with a table . put rattan ottoman in google . i bet you can find one there ! 
i do n't know i bought the chair to be in a office . 
dimensions of this chair are 29'h x 25 '' d x 26 '' w 
great-vacation america is the company . they are located in utah . they are wonderful to work with : ) 
no , it 's a manual wrap around but , it is a great vacuum ... love it ! 
great question . its actually one of the lightest full powered ( 12 amp ) vacuums on the market . it only weights 17.8 lbs right out of the box . so in the vacuum cleaner industry when you hear a weight of a vacuum it does not include the cord weight . why ? because while you are vacuuming the cord is usually on the ground and not on the vacuuming while you are vacuuming . i hope that helps : ) let us know if you have any other questions . thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
great question : ) let me go over the differences real quick . 1. the 7000 has led bulbs that probably wont ever need replaced . the 6000 has normal bulbs . 2. the 7000 has hospital grade real hepa filter while the 6000 has the standard hepa filter . if you have serious allergies the 7000 will be the one that you want to get . if not then the 6000 will be just fine . 3. on board tools . the main extension wand extends more on the 7000 and on the 7000 all the on board tools have their own spot where they snap onto the back of the vacuum . with the 6000 all the tools are attached to the outside of the main wand . either way tools on both models are easily used . 4. the 7000 model has the on off button right where your hand is when your vacuuming . so turning on and off is very simple . the 6000 has the on off on the body of the vacuum . i hope that helps : ) as you can see from the reviews either one is a great as they are a well built vacuum . these vacuums normally retail for 700 so its a good deal and they will last for many years to come . let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
the unit has an exhaust air outlet vent , consisting of exhaust pipe , adapter , window slider kit to exhaust out . i 'd say it is a complete unit . the only place i have to set it is in the living room for best use and i like it very much . 
the noise level is between 52-55 db ( a ) 
yes it does need to be ventilated but it only takes me about 5 minutes to do that . all your doing is running a hose out the window . 
the window kit only extends up to 52 inches . 
the data plate lists the wattage as rated input -- 980 watts . the voltage is 115 and the amp rating is 9.2 amps . if you have any other questions , feel free to ask ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 
6 '' diameter and about 6 feet in length 
yes , it is quiet . 
believe it 's home collection . they were a gift so i ca n't verify . 
no it does not bounce back . however is fairly comfortable no complaints from the wife 22 weeks in . 
no 
hi , i do n't think that it is . keep a cover on it so you can wash that . 
i would try to . i installed my unit in a 500sqft rectangular room . place the unit on a solid exterior wall with easy access for electrical and drainage . mount the exterior condensor above ground with the supplied wall mount . it looks clean and will be out of the way . i did have two leaking valves that cost me to have the unit recharged after 2 months of operation . either than that the unit is good for the price . 
for the indoor unit , yes , included . for the outdoor unit it is not needed if you will mount on a slab . otherwise brackets are available as optional accessory . 
absolutely.. heat pumps can not function without a defrost logic in heat mode . all pioneer units have a very sophisticated , self learning fuzzy defrost logic . 
for a perspective , i have a 615 sf one room cabin i built . i used a 18,000 btu ( 1 1 2 ton ) inverter unit here in northern missouri . even at 10 degrees below zero , it easily kept the house nice and warm . it was well insulated with 12 '' walls of r-32 . 
i do not know . 
answer is between 12k and 18k models . you need to select based on your heat load and insulation level whether to upsize or downsize . 
same as a standard queen bed 10-11 inches 
yes 
no , it does not 
i 'm 135 and husband is disabled and 190lbs . two of the six.legs are cracked to where ee ca n't use it . i highly recommend you look at s different bef honestly .

i am not to sure , but i do know this can cut unpeeled potatoes . i had a different style one that i had to actually cut potatoes in half and put cut side against the blades to get it to work . 
no 
yes 
they are a hard plastic so i would n't think you could easily cut them . 
no idea . 
am not sure . 
i have no idea , but i 'm assuming not because if they were it would be on the packaging . i just needed some cheap , temporary straws at christmas time that were a little stronger than disposables . we do still have them and people still use them from time to time . but if you want the good ones , i 'd get the stainless steel . those are supposed to be best for health . 
the top is 6 1 8th wide and has 5 1 4 in width between the rails . hope this helps . 
no , the finest blade is not that fine , i think it is 1 8th inch . it is more about creating long noodle shapes from the zucchini that taste great , and are very healthy , that will go with all kinds of sauces . it will not create as many shapes as you would get with pasta machine or dry pasta 
they even do butternut squash that i can barely even cut through ! 
that 's what i do 
yes

hi anette , i would just be guessing , but it is somewhere around 12-14 inches long by around 8 inches tall and maybe 6 inches wide . you can go on you tube and type in spiralizer in the search bar and see people demontrating it . i also got some great recipes off that site . here is the customer service number for spiralizer , so you can get the exact measurements . i hope that helps . do n't forget , that you store the different blades for the spiralizer right on the machine so you never have to go looking for them . have fun . nell . customer service 888-739-4172 
my favorite sources of recipes are ( free ) email rss feed subscriptions & twitter for : kalyn 's kitchen ; skinnytaste.com ; once upon a chef ; food52 . after that , do a google search for specific food items , entrees , food ingredients and look at a few of the plethora of recipes that will be presented . 'save as . . . ' these recipes into a folder in your computer 'documents ' library . i also print the recipes i like . there is a 'print ' button in most recipes . or , for practical prints with pictures -- i copy paste the text into a word document taking each little section of text at a time . some pictures will print to a reasonable size but most will take up whole pages of paper . 'copy ' or 'save as ' them to a working folder in your 'pictures ' library ; use a picture editor like `` paint.net '' ( free download for individuals personal use ) if you do not already have a suitable editor to resize them . i find most pics can be reduced 50 % or sometimes to ~30.0 kb and the final print will be easy to put on the print-out page so you can have a picture . double-spaced text ( ingredients ? ) can be single-spaced , other editing done , a by-line added so you will know later where the recipe originated . comments that add to the recipe can be included this way with much editing to eliminate waste space and items . then 'print ' the final version you made in word , 3-hole punch the page ( s ) and store in a 3-ring binder . most of my personally edited recipe prints take up one or two pages ( printed on both sides of a sheet of paper ) complete with one or two pictures and the comments that provide tips & variations . clear package-sealing tape can be used on one side of these multiple sheets to hold them together in the binder . punch holes after taping . the tape also reinforces the edge for the holes if needed . if you do not have word , `` open office '' is good and it is a free download ; be very careful where you download it from . 
yes it said on the description that it is bpa free . 
the wood is on the darker side . 
hi there ... unfortunately we do not have a matching buffet console to go with this set 
yes , this table includes a leaf . it is a 78 '' table with an 18 '' leaf . thank you for your inquiry . beyond stores . 888-349-6096 
actuallay its plastic ... metal on the rear of it.. 
hello , sorry we do not sell parts for this particular item . thank you 
no both of mine start in off mode . 
there is a vent in the rear so i would't put it against the wall . i have 2 of these heaters and use both so their is a least a foot of clearance on all sides . 
reason i bought this heater was an elderly woman from our church has a double wide mobile home that is uninsulated and she was constantly cold . they had a couple of radiator type heaters for their bedrooms that kept it bearable there but the living room kitchen dining area is wide open combining all of the above and that was unbearably cold . going over reviews written , checking the stats from the manufacturer , i came to the conclusion this was the answer . it arrived earlier than scheduled and just in time for the first cold front that same night . took it down to unpack and hook up . warmed the living area quite comfortably within a half hour of hookup . went to check the next a.m. to see how it did . the answer i got was she cried so i would say you should not have a problem . 
yes . it has wheels so you can easily move it . 
i bought one which was woefully inadequate . i complained and they said they would send another . nothing happened . i am very busy and have not pursued it . my advice buy something else . i suspect it is a cheap rip off of something else . 
ca n't say i remember but the one i bought is heating an uninsulated area comprised of kitchen , dining area , and living room of a double wide mobile home and could actually heat the two bedrooms one on either side if they left the doors open . one of the women living there just turned 75 and has circulation problems like a lot of those of that age and she calls to thank me every couple of days for getting it for her . 
i suspect it could . depending on the thickness of the material , i think this steamer could work just as well on curtains as it does on my suits . 
a little when you first start using it , but not bad enough to be a problem . 
works with voltage 110 and it works great . 
does not work well . is not strong 
yes 
i could n't get it to work either . i returned it 
this item works great on 110 , the 110 plug in is the only one that came with the steamer so i assume that it is not dual voltage . 
no . it seems a widemouth lid should fit but the jar top seems to be slightly smaller . 
no idea . but it 's 16 oz with a double wall so ice cold water never seaps through . the handle does n't allow it to go in a cup holder . 
i do n't think so . the jar comes with kids 
just one . i bought 2 but each was separate . i love them ! 
plastic 
no it is only on one side . i use mine as christmas coverlets on the beds . very colorful and elegant . 
not that i know of . 
it is 12 1 2 inches wide and very lovely . 
the runner is 68 '' l x 12.5 '' w . 
the rail is fixed and the child does crawl over it . 
yes , the ladder is included in the suggested price . 
yes the full is not connected to rest of bed . but there is no headboard 
the hight is 64 '' the width from the storage area to the right of the lower mattress is 80 '' the lenght over all of the lower section is 80 '' 
thick card board i think 
it seems like a really sturdy layered cardboard , so it 's light . it 's not metal or wood . the outer part is lightly padded and has a slightly plastic feel , so it would wipe clean pretty easily . i like mine a lot . 
a ton ! i 'd say at least 100 
the width of the box inside extends to 6 3 16 `` ( 6.1875 ) it wo n't fit . 
yes . the lid is hinged . 
yes - this was far too large for my daughters twin . should easily fit a double and probably even a queen 
yes - you need to put a hook of some sort into the ceiling and the net has a loop on the top that slips on to the hook . 
yes , there are attachments that can clean the fabric on a couch . 
vacuum first 
around 10 pounds . small footprint , compact design . consider something with a more powerful motor 
not really . i have found you do n't really want the water to be too hot . just hot tap water and the cleaning solution should be fine for 95 % of home clean ups . this bissell 's heating element keeps the water warm and that 's all that 's really needed . 
no , but it does n't take up too much room , about the same as a large upright sweeper . and our floors are cleaner than when we pay a professional carpet cleaner . 
i have berber , but i think you can . 
l 7 '' x w 5-1 2 '' x h 3 4 '' 
i would say so . it is a very accurate little scale . i do n't know what you weigh the soap in , just make sure your container is not so large that it covers the digital readout . i use this scale for packaging feta cheese in 8-oz . deli containers and it works beautifully . 
china 
no 
no , it does n't . 
yes ! in fact , it has one of the largest number of accessories i was able to find . they are made of plastic , but so far this they are working well . also , the terrycloth cover for steaming fabrics fits quite tight , but putting a washcloth over the attachment with a rubber band works just as well . 
yes 
you be better off buying a weed torch from home depot . 
any drugstore or pharmacy 
the steam is n't completely dry ; it 's damp . 
according to the web site www.vapamore.com it has a 1000 watt heating element . 
only if you use the water that was collected from the evaporated water and brought back to a liquid state . the point of distilled water is to have water that is pre-evaporated so that it only contain particles that are small enough or vaporize early enough to go through the steamer without building up and blocking the ports . 
no - the unit heats the water . 
120 volts 
300 lbs . per cushion , so 600 lbs . 
nope . not long enough for an adult to sleep on comfortably either . it 's just a love seat . 
i had been hoping for grey but it is more brown 
this love seat is firm , so if you 're looking for a plush sofa you really sink into , it may not be for you . i think it 's comfortable and would buy it again . bonus : it was easy enough for me to put together by myself . 
3 
yes . there should be instructions for washing included in the installation instructions . 
every review i have read says they wish they would have bought the sleep innovations mattress for $ 400 ish instead of $ 3,000++ you can see some reviews on sleep like the dead forum site . i have a sleep innovations mattress and it is surely the best i have ever had in nearly 50 years . also , if there is ever a problem with mattress you take a photo of it and fax or email them a request and they mail you a new mattress no questions ask not that you will need another one ! http : www.sleeplikethedead.com bed-mattress-review-home.html 
platform style beds are the best . but i kep my boxspring from my old bed and set the ned mattress ontop . i was 4+ feet in the air 
yes 
yes , there is , actually 
yes 
it 's a pointed tip that you can push right into the meat . 
yes you can stick it in the meat to see if it has reached proper temperature . i would not leave it in the meat . 
no 
yes 
no , this is just for meat temperature and it works great . 
yes , an 11 inch dinner plate fits inside the microwave . 
yes 
yes , it does . 
absolutely . power 10 for 3 minutes . i go 3:30 and watch it the last minute . works great . i love it 
i do n't understand the question . rephrase it . 
i left it in . it has reflective material on it , so i 'm assuming it serves a purpose . been using my microwave for months now and no probs with it being in there . 
yes . there is a dial on the micro that gives you several options for heating and cooking foods including popcorn and reheating meals . the interior glass tray also rotates for even cooking .

its says in the description is has evaporative technology so no water to remove.. `` *auto evaporation system allows continuous use without removing water '' 
the lg lp1414shr , 14,000 btu consumes approximately 1,380 watts . thank you for your inquiry . 
it does come with a large venting hose and all the necessary trim pieces to fit it in most standard slider windows . we used it in florida and it never needed to be emptied and kept 600 sq ft area comfortable ( low 70s ) . 
it must be vented out to a window . 
it does produce noise , but quieter than my last unit . 
yes , assuming you 're not a very large size . i am women 's size 14 , and i can . 
we do not offer personalization of our aprons . 
the neck strap is adjustable from 15 inches to 26 inches . each waist strap measures 42 inches in length . 
7 '' w x 7.5 '' h. large enough to fit two 12oz long neck beers in each . 
well , it is going to get a bit dirty in the kitchen ! my husband fills it with flour while making christmas cookies . we just toss it in the wash with all the other towels . cleans up great ! it is durable . 
good morning . most of our customers have had no issues machine washing using the gentle or hand wash cycle . line or lay flat to dry - slight touch up with a steam iron ( if needed ) and they look great ! i am a single dad with 2 boys and use them on my bed . i have had no issues washing them - the ironing part i plead the fifth ! have a wonderful weekend . craig fishers finery customer service 
mine measures approximately 28 x 19.5 inches . 
the case is larger than the average queen pillowcase . i use it on a pure dunlopillo pillow that is thick and full . the case fit generously . 
no 
i 'm not sure , i ordered a burgandy one . 
neither look wrinkled . i personally like the gray one better . 
they are 100 % silk and made in china . 
i do not know . 
these are made in china . and a joke when you see them . pay attention to the size as if you are expecting standard size ice-trays you will be sorely disappointed . they are no bigger than the palms of my hands . 
just got this today . the plastic wrapping says made in china . 
cubes are a optic one inch square . they are easy to eject from tray . but i wish i had bought additional trays . you can tell from photos about how big they are based on cube size . would buy again and an to 
mine haven't.. had them for a cpl months now , love them ! 
currently , we do not carry silicone cup cake cups . however , we are looking to expand out kitchen line to include things like this ! please check back with us soon . i am sure we will be doing some form of promotion for this . thanks ! 
i did n't know that silicone products were toxic . i have been using silicone spatulas since they have come out on the market because the other types fell apart during cooking . since the silicone ones held up , i order the ice trays . my husband and i have suffered no ill effects . 
mr. brush , each cavity is a 1 '' x 1 '' x 1 '' square cube . these are typically smaller than your average ice cube , but that was intentional . tundra inc. really wanted to provide a space-saving , quality ice cube tray and that is what we have done . we will be providing a medium and large size in the near future , as well as a variety of colors potentially , so be on the lookout for that . i hope this answers your question and should you purchase the trays , i hope they work out for you ! thank you for your question and happy halloween ! sincerely , tundra incorporated 
probably , but i would not recommend it . bacon spatters grease which would hit the heating element and could start a fire 
absolutely . i 've made them . in less time than traditional deep-frying -- and with no oil . 
if you dip it in buttermilk and then the breadcrumbs or whatever , yes it will . as long as it 's not dripping . if its dripping , the fan may blow all the liquid off the meat . the basket is not that big , room for about 3 legs or two breasts . the cooking is done by super-heated , recirculating air . that 's why if you are doing fish sticks or chicken tenders , you need to spray a little cooking spray on the items so they have a little moisture and are not completely dried out . aso , i believe they just came out with a larger capacity model . you might check that so you can make more fried chicken pieces at one time . 
7 '' x7 '' x3 '' 
yes , it comes . 
120v , at least mine is . 
it holds a pint ... i am a pig so i would want to drink a little more smoothie . but the lid does not leak and has a built in rubber gasket . 
not really sure how many exactly , to be honest . but it 's a little bigger than a soda can , if that helps . 
yes ! small mouth mason jars : ) 
i think so . the picture looks like the jars i have too . hope they work for you 
yes , they slide along the bar . read the directions about turning the inside ring to create the suction . i have to say it look really nice . 
hello ! the temperature range is ( -58f to 572f ) ( -50c to 300c ) , thank you ! 
yes it would work fine . 
it is capable of reading the temperature of a roast or a turkey , but not to be used as a conventional meat thermometer and left in place during the entire cooking process . 
hello , this item can not be used in the oven . it has a plastic housing . thank you ! 
within 2 numbers example says 52 when it is 54 degrees i also use floating therm too one of the reviews recommended put in a plastic bag my husband did not want to do that and it got full of water to put it in a plastic bag i am now going to put mine in a plastic bag of it seems to make no difference in anything as far as degrees go better safe than sorry for the price it is worth it 
the entire unit is plastic with a stainless finish . 
yes , this product has a 2 year warranty . i now have three different simplehuman products and have nothing but rave reviews for all three . they are great quality and look really nice ! 
you can find it behind the dispenser spigot ( on the back ) will find a plus and minus sign press that section and a blinking like should come up unless your unit is not equipped with that feature 
this is about 2 '' x 2 1 2 '' and about 9 `` height works well . 
no 
the sensor is in the `` head '' . what is great is that it 's looking down , not forward . i read reviews of other pumps that are so sensitive that you walk by and they get activated . not this one , as this is `` looking '' down and it only dispenses soap when you want it to . i had it for eight months , and love it . 
yes . i use mine for smoothies a lot ... even for milk shake consistency . the straw is wide enough and , if needed , you can remove the straw and shake up the smoothie to redistribute the ingredients ( in the event that you did n't drink it right away ) . 
yes , as a matter of fact , the spring loaded flap on the lid that closes when the straw is removed also keeps the straw from moving around on its own . i just shook an empty tumbler with the straw inside and the straw never moved or made a sound , even without any liquid in the glass . this is a great tumbler ! 
not really ; there is n't much for insulation . but they have a very functional straw and closing system . 
yes , this is 100 % bpa free . as are most contigo brand items . 
i just always put the straws & tumbler in the dishwasher ! i also do that very thing with all our toothbrushes ! blessings on your day ! 
yes it can ! i removed it to make a broach bouquet ! 
no it does n't screw off . however , the green sponge on the inside can be wet or dampen to provide moisture to fresh flowers . beware this item is small in case you were looking for a more fuller looking bouquet 
i believe it 's more metal all throughout the handle , it makes a metallic `` clink '' when you tap it with a fingernail or something that is plastic . it 's probably only silver plated though , so take care not to scratch it . the crystal and pearl inlays are most definitely plastic however . i hope i answered your question to your satisfaction , do n't hesitate to ask any more : ) 
if you look there are small tabs just above the silver portion of the piece you push them in and pull up on the white grid . 
yes i use fake flowers but still beautiful 
hi , it is resin 
small should be a little bigger for a brides bouquet 
8 '' & 10 '' 
8 '' and 12 in 
yes - i love these pans 
check description on amazon ... it says that yes they are free of them . 
ours did not . 
yes , it will work on induction ranges . and to the person that replied saying `` i do n't know , i 'm really amateurish '' , why even bother answering the question ? 
i honestly do n't know . i do n't have an inductance cooking system -- use a regular electric range . that sounds like something you 'd have to ask the manufacturer . 
this grinder grinds very well . if you turn it back upside down , and grind with it upside down , it will grind extremely fine . definitely enough for a vape . but not on the first grind . hope that helps . 
yes 
yes..you certainly could ! it might be a bit tricky like you 'll have to cut the cinnamon sticks in pieces first then grind it , same as the cloves . the teeth of this grinder is extremely sharp so i warn anyone using this grinder on not throwing caution to the wind..it could cut you without you even knowing it so be very careful using this . other than that it 's a superb and finely made grinder . i have used mine for many things including herbs like thyme and rosemary , whole peppercorns and big seeds . a highly recommended product and you can not possibly go wrong getting this for yourself for it comes in handy . i hope i answered your question . : ) 
i 've had the opportunity to use a space case for a short while . i want to start by saying it is a really great grinder and that i can see why it 's considered the best . both griders do the same thing , not one better than the other . i would say the space case is built a bit more heavy duty , but that is mostly for aesthetic purposes . what it really comes down to is if you want to spend that extra money for feel , not extra function . the ggg really is top notch . it looks great , grinds well , the keef screen never clogs , and there is plenty of room in the middle chamber to store . space case is viewed as the best becase it has function and feel , but that comes at a price . ggg gives the same level of functionality , with slightly less aesthetics , for a much much much better price . so overall if you have cash to burn i guess get the space case , but really your not going to get much more bang for your buck . 
manual . but it 's a very smooth twist . 
yes it does an amazing job with fresh herbs ! 
26 to 35 '' 
no , it is made from a vinyl but it really is a great fake ! and very good job on the upholstery work . 
it 's adjustable . i have mine on the shortest height , and it 's perfect for my countertop . i do n't have a tape measure , or i 'd be more specific . 
250lbs or less 
when connecting the chair , be sure to remove the black plastic cap that is on one of the chair peices . it looks like it belongs but doesnt . if not removed , the chair wo n't adjust 
yes 
approx . 14 1 4 '' high by 15 '' deep and 10 1 4 '' wide . it is about the size of most keurig machines , you need the same clearance at the top to open the brewer mechanism . works great and not having to add water manually is a big plus . 
yes , if you do n't mind refilling the water 3 to 5 times a day 
this is very easy to use . this is my second one , and i have about 30 people in the office who use this on a daily basis , several times a day . reliable and good , hot coffee tea . 
do n't know about that brand reusable filter but you should be able to . i used a standard reusable filter on the one i had . 
i can vacuum my entire downstairs which takes about 30 minutes and i still have a good charge on it 
hey lori , this vacuum weights 7.5 pounds 
i think it does . 
i do not know , but we have had ours for several months and it recently stopped working . we will be sending it to a repair shop to fix . can not recommend this unit . 
the `` filter '' is just a simple mesh filter that is attached to the lid that matches the geometry of the spout . the mesh is about the same density as a french press filter , it is only going to be good for filtering out larger particles from your water ... but if you are using water that has crap in it ... uhh.. you may have other issues : p 
no there is not from what i can see and feel , it appears that the glass has a lip in the bottom that is mated to the lip of the metal base . i can tell you we use it every day and love it . we have an 1100 watt microwave and this kettle can heat the same amount of water in the same or faster time than the microwave can . regards 
well.. the `` filter '' is nothing more then a framed piece of nylon mesh like a reuseable coffee filter . it only covers the spout so if ( for some odd reason ) you have a bunch of floating crud in your water it will not pour into your glass . it does look like you could pop it out if you really wanted to remove it , but just in case i snap a mounting post on it i did not try . 
it 's 2 prong 
hi michael , i answered too quickly ... sorry . the bottom is a metal heating element . 
yes we can do that . so you are telling me that the hose has no pigtail to plug into the wall . 
it has a pigtail power chord that plugs into a wall outlet to power the motorized vac head 
this is a full tang blade , so it extends all the way to the end of the handle . the bolster seems to be a separate piece . i would ask yoshihiro to confirm , but this is what i see from my knife . 
i have n't let mine stay wet . i use it and then hand wash and dry it . high carbon steel does rust and the knife has layers of stainless steel and high carbon steel . i imagine that if you put it away wet it would rust . the core is high carbon steel . that 's what makes the edge . you would n't want the edge to rust . 
mine was oob @ 15 , but i took it down to 14 
i think cooler than just the mattress or a regular pad , but i ca n't say as it actually `` cools '' you . 
surprisingly no . i 'm a warm sleeper and i have n't notice any bed temperature differences since adding the topper . 
hi spanky it sure is . you 'll have no problem with the dimensions . thanks ! 
a traditional queen mattress measures 60 '' wide by 80 '' long . an olympic queen is 66 '' wide by 80 '' long . the mattress pad we bought ( and the one referred to here is the 60 x 80 inch ) . i have been in the bedding business since 1975 when the main-stream models were twin ( 39x75 ) , full ( 54x75 ) , queen ( 60x80 ) west coast queen ( 60x84 ) , king ( 76x80 ) , and california king ( 72x84 ) . you should note that these are united states ' sizes and that there are 6 international bedding standards : n. america , australia , uk & ireland , new zealand [ 5 ] continental europe & latin america , and japan . somoe of the bedding sizes within these standards are slithgly different in size and some are substantially diferent . now that there are several `` micro '' bedding companies ( similar to micro-breweries ) , there are a plethora of different sizes . if you want to buy reasonably priced bed clothes , then going outside of the 'norm ' will , no doubt , not only cost you , but it will limit your choices . the mattress pad we bought are conventional size and make a remarkable difference in the conventional queen size bedding we have . we have chosen to stay with conventional sizes as we have a bed and breakfast and with more than one bed , having a 'standard ' size to each room is cost-effective . i hope this helps you . 
no , it 's just a mattress cover itself , it 's one piece . 
hi kara . this jar is approximately 8.2 inches tall by 3 inches wide . i hope this helps !

hello , the discovery world furniture captains beds are made of pine not particle board no press board . thanks , drew 
not if you order has already shipped if the order has not yet shipped or you have not yet placed and order than we would have to create a 12 drawer package for you ( $ 200 extra for the 2nd set of 6 drawers . ) if the order has shipped or you bought the bed elsewhere we can not sell you the drawers alone , as they do not ship well and it would cost $ 150++ for shipping to crate the drawers and even then that would not guarantee a safe delivery , very delicate piece to try to deliver . thanks , drew 
hello , i am sorry but the fullsize captains bed only comes in merlot and honey . thanks , drew 
yes

hi rob , sorry but we only ship within the united states . 
i would say it is light to medium . we live in virginia and even in the winter i think this is going to do just fine . it 's not heavy but not light either . my son is actually sleeping on top of it right now and covering up with a light blanket and it 's the beginning of september . he 's a really hot natured kid though . hope this helps . 
it would fall over the sides which is nice and cosy but it will not fit any single duvet comforter cover . 
yes ! it is ! 
no , it does n't have anything like that . i actually would n't recommend this product at all . 
it is full , but you have to know it is polymer 
do n't know . sorry that i am not more helpful .

thermal carafe but the heater turns off before the coffee is fully brewed so it is always lukewarm : (

two sheets . i 've used these for several months and really like them . each sheet is just a few inches wider than my narrow oven , and it curls up the sides a bit , which makes them even better at keeping the oven clean . i recommend them . 
the package that the liners came in never stated it could be used in microwaves . i usually use it in my oven so using it in your microwave would be taking a chance you may or may not have a positive outcome . 
it caused a few burns to the bottom of my new oven ! i think because i had my oven at 400 .

this is the only counter microwave that is in this color and the only size . thank you 
actual size is 11 3 4 '' high by 24 '' wide and 12 '' deep . take into consideration the power cord that extends out from the back top right . after cutting out a bit of wallboard to accommodate the cord bending , i was able to place microwave on a standard 11 3 4 '' shelf with one inch extending out beyond the shelf . 
dear lynn , you can mount this microwave under a cabinet with the purchase of the mounting kit model # jxa019k . 
i bought it for making fries . the thing you put the food in is about the size of a soda can . and it did not make fries well at all . it does seem like it will work for other things . it looks to be the exact same product as the link posted-and there are 70 mixed reviews that you can check out . http : www.qvc.com qvc.product.k14798.html 
we have sliced several kinds of vegetables and cheese , and it has several `` blades '' for different things . we 've never tried tomatoes , though , but it works well on what we 've tried so far so do n't see why it would n't slice tomatoes if you found the right blade for what you need . that took some trial and error attempts . 
i do n't know , i ran it on 120 volts and i was not happy with it at all . it did not grate cheese well and it had too many parts to clean afterwards . 
i actually did not try it for anything else , when it did not grate the cheese ( which is the main reason i bought it ) i tossed it in the garbage bin . the other problem i had was there were too many parts to clean after use . 
unfortunately it will not slice potatoes thin enough for potato chips , you should consider a different device for that purpose . 
not if you have a standard height counter top . we bought these because they were adjustable so high . even at their lowest setting , i is highly unlikely . 
we actually have 4 of these chairs on an exotic brazilian wood floor with no issues . the bottoms have a rubber ring around it that they rest on . i would recommend if you buy them to periodically lift them up and see if the rubber is coming off like i do just to insure your floor . we 've not had any issues with the rubber coming off so far . if you are anything like i am i 'd rather toss a $ 50 chair then ruin a several thousand dollar floor . hope this helps you .

i bought this tuscany canister set , as well as the bread box in mid january . i have n't had any moisture problems . i live in northern maine and heat with wood so the air in my house is dry and i use a humidifier . let suggestion would be to check the humidity level in your house . 
thank you for your inquiry . sorry , there is no white one yet . 
the large one holds about five pounds of flour . second one holds almost five pounds of sugar

i 've just checked the box . it does not mention whether it is or it is n't . there 's no writing on the box to list ingredients , etc . when the box arrived there was no paperwork inside the box either . the outside of the box is really very plain and does not say much about the product . if i had encountered this in a store , i would have left it on the shelf . unless you can contact the manufacturer you are not going to find out if it is bpa free . i 'm sorry .

it is only available in 1 color : black . thank you , customer service 
the height ranges from 17 '' to 24 '' in height with a seat diameter of 15 '' . 
yes , with the following conditions . the opening on your water reservoir needs to be big enough to allow you to drop it in . also , you do n't want this plugging the water as is comes out of the reservoir either . oh , you may not want to use it in steam evaporators if there 's a chance it could reach the heating element . 
the homedics cartridge is about an inch long and barely 1 2 '' wide . the info on the package says it will treat 1 gallon of water for about 40 fillings . depending on the volume of water in your humidifier ... it should work . it is a small gamble ... i am using it in a non-homedics humidifier ... a dual tank walgreen 's . i place one cartridge in each tank ... each of which is just slightly over 1 2 a gallon . it lasts 6 weeks of daily fillings . 
yes . i have used this in our for the last year . i change them about once a month . because we use our ultrasonic humidifier every night . 
i used it for ultrasonic humidifier for medium to large rooms and i did not find it to be very effective in reducing removing white dust 
according to the instructions , they will last 30-40 fillings of the tank . in my case it is about every 3 months which is similar to the older filters . 
yes you can . if you have really hard water you will get a white film on your furniture . even with the demineralization cartridge i have a white film on my furniture , but we do have very hard water . i still have to clean the dang thing . 
product weight ( lbs ) : 46 
as an air conditioner , it dehumidifies and water pools in the bottom to drain out . as a separate dehumidifier ? no . 
as long as the ac can fit in the opening and the back can extend far enough out to drain away from the house , i do n't see why not . you just may have to shim it somehow to get a tight fit all the way around and make sure nothing obscures the air flow .

the mattress is medium firmness . my wife likes firm mattresses whereas i like softer . we are both satisfied with this mattress . it 's been nothing but a good buy . quality material and just as good as the big time name brands . i also believe the manufacturer makes them as they are ordered . it 's heavy though so open it by the bed frame lol . 
no i had to buy one separate i am also experienced bad new on the bed the top layer of foam went bad i am the only one that sleeps on it after 8 mos i am fighting with the company to get a replacement since it does have a warranty 
yes . my husband is 6 ' and this fits him just fine . and it 's super comfy . we know 2 others that have ordered this same mattress and they love it too . 
not at all . i used to get hot on my other mattress but i think this one has a cooling layer because i have not , and i got it last summer so i it is not because of weather . 
yes 
not really but the mattress is great 
no , it does n't . i just have the mattress and i put it on a ikea bed frame and it fitted perfectly . 
weight is a force . it is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration . 
yes ! i have 3 cats and they kick litter up like crazy , this pulls it right out of the carpet . 
a short vacuum brush , a short brushless wide vacuum brushand a 1 & 1 2 foot flat vacuum tube . that 's it . 
it is not specifically self propelled but the brush spins hard enough to pull it ! best vaccume i have ever owned 
yes it will 
i found them on amazon . 
yes . it works well on any flat , hard floor .

there are setting for 3 languages : english , korean and chinese .

no . heavy diamond with ceramic coat . 
english manual is available for crp-hz06 ( 220volt version ) which has english korean front panel too . take a look . why the us version crp-hz0683f front panel is still not ? https : www.dropbox.com s i88uz5iziv9gba0 crp-hz0683f % 20 % eb % af % b8 % ec % a3 % bc % ed % 96 % a5 % 20 % 28383-885b % 29.pdf 
the other answer is incorrect . please refer to page 20 of the product manual where `` gaba rice '' is listed as one of the modes available . page 24 goes into detail about how to use that mode ( http : www.cuckoomallusa.com emanual english crp-hz0683f % 20english.pdf ) 
no warranty info came with the product . 
this is programmed for the remotes it comes with . i do not know if you can add to the unit , but it works great as it is . 
yes 
not sure why you 'd want to , but no . you 'd have to unplug the ringers from the wall . 
the two units that plug in are inside the house and the unit that is outside is on the house under a porch roof so i think it will be fine . it has been installed for about a month now and we have had rain , so i think it will be fine . it is a lot better than the total battery operated ones .

what does that even mean .

this mattress was manufactured in china . 
yes it can . but one side does not have as much cushion as the other . 
no , i am 6 ft and weigh around 180lb . 
it is pretty portable when it is brand new and un-opened . but once the vacuum sealed bag is opened , it becomes a normal spring mattress . 
it 's a standard us queen , i purchased a queen frame and it fit perfectly 
i would say 2 and 3 year olds although small 4 year olds may be able to use it also . we use it for our 2 year old and she loves it . 
i contacted the company , simplyglobo , on 03 11 2014 , and was told , `` the actual dimensions of the sleeping area for the lazynap lz-04k kids air mattress are : 43 '' x20 '' x8 '' . hopefully this information helps other interested buyers - the company should update the product details description though to make sure that everyone sees the information . 
it has its own and it t is pretty good . a crib one will be too small and a single one too big 
about 2 to 3 minutes 
not at all ! it comes with an electric pump and takes about 2-3 minutes to fully inflate . 
i would not put anyone on it over 3 years old , mine ripped right on the seam . 
yes , it comes with all of that . i had read it came with american and european electrical plug - it only comes with us plug , so you 'll have to use a plug adapter to use it overseas . 
power requirement is universal @ 100-240 volts . only the connector needs to be adapted . thanks for your interest . brian wiredforless 
no 
it needs to be plugged in to a power source but you can bluetooth music from your phone or something . it sounds amazing by the way . worth it 
it 's machine washable with special instructions tons on blanket or you can wash by hand

oddly this is not mentioned in the manual at all . call biddeford at 800-789-6441 and ask them . after all , virtually all electric blankets are under some bed spread or comforter , so i do n't see why not . best to ask them .

sylicone is not plastic . it does not contain pba . 
it has n't yet and i have made meatloaf several times and loaf cakes . you just have to be very careful when you remove it from the oven as it is not stable . but i still love it because it is so easy to clean and the ridges in the bottom keep the meatloaf from sitting in the grease from the meat . 
i have no idea . 
hi keyla ! i 'm not sure if you can use a rivo pod with this grinder . what i do know is that it does come with a large capacity plastic bin . you can utilize this bin to keep large amounts of ground coffee to use as you need it . so , in essence you could use a rivo pod in a round about indirect way ... .lol ! ! ! : -d 
i dont seem to have that problem , set at 1 for k cup or 2 for vue 
yes ! works great with one issue . we have the little brown greed red plastic ones . ( not metal ) they do give you one of theirs though ( a little better design too ) . the issue is that this grinder always grinds too much , even on setting `` 1 '' . so you have to stop it manually after 5 6 seconds . if you do n't mind that , it 's a lot easier than refilling those from a bag . 
it 's not a blender dude . 
we poured booze into measuring cup then into sunscreen container . 
i ca n't give u a simple y or n 'cause : ( 1 ) i did not try to take it aboard the plane in my carry-on & ( 2 ) re the suitcase i checked , the `` thing '' was empty as i did not fill it until i arrived in south america where i filled it prior to boarding the cruise ship ( which does not allow `` spirits '' 2 b brought on-board . it went through the ship 's version of tsp just fine because they did not do a full body scan nor a pat down and it was in my jacket pocket & i was not required to send my jacket through the scanner . nevertheless , i thick the quality of the `` thing '' looks fine & i had no problem with any leakage , so i plan to use it again and again . suggestions : put the `` thing '' in your carry-on & not on your carry aboard luggage as i do n't think it would make it through an airport tsp check , which only allows a max of 4 oz ; consider filling it only 1 2 full to minimize any loss due to discovery ; wait to fill it until u r at your destination & not boarding a plane but rather a cruise ship or attending a concert or whatever , and do n't put it in your backpack which is more likely to be searched than your jacket or crotch or whatever . hope this helps a tad . abe 
a little over 5 shots . one shot is equivalent to 1.5 ounces . the bottle holds 8 ounces . 
the inside dimensions are 59 inches wide , by 46.25 inches heigh , by 41.5 inches deep . 
this is n't an official answer by any means , but i do n't think you can . the bed has a different method of attaching it on the stairs side than it does on the drawer side . 
59 inches in length , 42 inches in width and 46 inches in height 
the chests can not be replaced by poles . the bed is very sturdy . i do n't think poles alone would be enough to support its weight . on the bright side , the drawers come pre-assembled so it is much easier to put together than i originally thought . 
the top mounting plate dimensions are 3 '' x 1 15 16 '' 
it 's only one piece . 
i would assume so as long as you put wooden slats under the base . 
i do n't remember this , but i used it with a `` platform '' bed that uses a series of slats rather than a box springs . i affixed the claw to a piece of 4 foot square plywood that i then screwed into several of the slats and this worked well for me . 
substantial ! very nice quality . i bought these for a ladies group to share . as an after thought , i wish i did not get upholstered chairs because i do n't know that others will take as good a care of the fabric chairs as i would . so , if you are going to `` share '' or store in the garage , you may want to consider all plastic chairs . otherwise a beautiful , dressy , high quality set . 
the chair are fairly strong because i weigh 220 # and they have held up well for mee . 
the top is 30 '' x 30 '' and it stands 26-3 4 '' tall 
i am not sure of the exact height . the manufacturer 's information should have that . i will tell you that i think they are a little low . i am 5'8 '' so i guess it 's relative . i would measure for you but i do n't have access to them right now . 
33 3 4 x 33 3 4 
the table is 34 inches square and about 28 inches high . i have a card table that is slightly smaller and another that is slightly larger . hope this helps . fg

i am 5'9 and not skinny and i find it quite comfortable 
approx 36 `` x 36 '' by 8 '' to 10 '' thick it was vacuum packed ! it really expands when opened ! ! 
no , it does n't have to be against the wall ! i had the same concern , but my son and his friends can lean back on it no problem . the chair has very strong bands that attach to velcro at both sides . i ca n't speak to how long they will last -- we 've had it for about 6 months . 
its almost sofa level . i have a sectional sofa and when this is sitting next to it , i can still put my arm on the sofa arm from the chair 
no , no recipe and no instructions 
they claim a lifetime warranty . 
you pull it out in the same time you push the secure line below the blade ... hard to explain jajaj hope it was clear 
i 've only used it to make zoodles . i do n't think it can be used for parking veggies . 
i use this fan every day . it is 14 '' high , 12 3 4 '' wide , and 10 '' deep . i am very satisfied with the fan . iam 80 yrs old and live in the south east us . sit most of the day in my chair . keep a c on 80 degrees , with the fan on low about 8 ft away . quiet and comfortable 
the wattage is 55w . the airflow at the quiet setting 9fps ; low setting is 15 fps ; medium setting is 18 fps ; and high setting is 21 fps . hope this helps ! 
the fan tilts both up and down ... do not tilt fan manually , use the oscillating feature to get to the desired position , then turn the oscillating feature off . 
as listed in the 2013 instruction manual & warranty `` warning : do not hang or mount this fan on ceiling . do not operate this fan in oscillation mode when it is wall mounted . '' 
ozf2 only has automatic horizontal oscillation . the ozf4 has auto dual-oscillation . 
yes , there is a screw in the front where the front panel should come off for cleaning . 
flag it as a gift when you order and amazon will place it inside an unmarked box to avoid revealing the contents . 
the chair itself is a darker brown similar to chocolate . the cording is a creamish tan color . it is a good looking chair 
not sure but i 've had two people in it 350 pounds total ... very sturdy . 
it 's pretty big , i will have to check the measurements but it can easily fit a 300 lb person . 
it is a micro fiber . 
the back locks in place . it will take a couple people working in concert to get it apart , not easy . but those same people could turn it on its side and move it around a corner 
the seat is approximately 23-inches wide from the inside of each armrest . the depth is approximately 18.5-inches . 
a standard twin is 75l by 39w . the foam topper is cut an inch or two less to make the sheet fit properly over it . if you have a extra long twin , leave the extra space at the top . because of your pillow you wo n't need the foam cushion there and the pillows will also hide the uneven plane when you make the bed . 
no . this item is not made of memory foam . i ca n't believe anyone answered yes . they must have made a mistake during the questioning process . i almost answered yes accidentally because of the way amazon asked . they said can you answer a question for this member - is this a memory foam topper ? i was thinking yes i can answer the question , but no it 's not a memory foam topper . but they only had one selection . funny stuff . anyway . you 're welcome . i might mention that my wife and i were so surprised at the comfort quality that we are going to buy another one soon . 
the box is only ( approximately ) 17 x 8 x 14. the topper is air compressed ( think spacebag ) . just remove it from the box , open the compression bag , then let it air ( to remove the foam rubber odor ) for 48 hours . and yes , the foam odor does , absolutely , disperse . after airing there is no odor . 'could n't be more please with price , delivery and quality of this product ! 
while it is comfortable , i would n't say it is that comfortable . it is better suited to put on top of a mattress . 
the material is not very thick and thins under weight , so i am not sure how comfortable it would be on a hard surface . it would help some though 
well the foam mattress is 2 inches thick and i would n't suggest to roll it up not unless you have room to carry it other than that is worth a try 
i do n't recommend to use any type of glass on stove . 
i use this dish to bake pound cakes . my recipe calls for a total of 9 cups of combined ingredients . the batter fits the dish well and bakes beautifully , almost to the top of the dish ( rising during baking doubles the volume ) . depending on what you are baking and how much of a rise you expect , you should be able to use at least 10 cups of batter , or at least 12 cups of liquid for aspic or an ice ring . 
i'e had no problems with cakes sticking in this pan . i do use pam in it first . i love it . 
10 '' x9 '' # 9 '' high 
that and a lot more than what you have listed . extremely roomy with lots of pockets . got this for my granddaughter for her freshman year in college . i could n't believe how versatile this caddy is and extremely well made . 
the shower caddy is all netting . it will not stand on it 's own when empty . if it is loaded with your shampoo , etc . it will should stand , depending on how it 's loaded . it 's perfect for a dorm or if you are sharing a bathroom . 
no the strap does not fit over your shoulder once you put all your accessories in it , but the caddy is large enough for everything you need for the shower and more . 
yes ! just make sure you roll it up a little bit . the towel may peek out a little from the top but it should n't be too much over the edge . 
with the quality of this product , i do n't believe you will have that problem . it is extremely well made and unless you overstuff it ( which i do n't believe will be necessary ) it should n't rip at all . my suggestion is to keep the information you receive with the caddy and contact the manufacturer if you have any problem . 
yes it is according to me . it carried my hair blow dryer along with my shampoo+conditioner , body wash , face wash , brush , comb & wash clothes . 
25 '' wide with vents . 13 1 16 height with legs . great microwave ! 
between the centers of foot pads , 18.25 inches wide , 13.5 inches deep . the front foot pads have short cylindrical `` legs '' attached , while the rear foot pads are just bottom bumps . 
13 h x 24 1 2 w x 19 1 2 d 
mine did not come with one . 
it is 110v version 
yes , it is fully 110v . i have had the mattress for about two weeks and it is awesome ! 
30 - 36 c 
hi , amazon shipping states 10 - 15 days , but we ship almost same day as we get order in . and only takes 3-5 days depends on where you are . new jersey , 1-2 days , california 4-5 days . thank you , 
yes , they claim they are the first company in korea to offer such feature . as you can see from the picture , it has the dual zone control you 're seeking . 
no , we do not have king size . however most of users are satisfy with queens size mat . when you put it on king size bed , it covers 85 % which should be enough to accommodate two people comfortably also king size will have issue with distribution of heat . therefore queen size is very good size to use . we have not received any size issue selling queens size over 8 years . 
i 'm usually able to make 4 and sometimes 5. i fill it about 2 3 of the way . i bought these 6 months ago and really like it . 
sorry i have been having email trouble and just saw your question . if you still need to know the measurements they are 6.9 x 2.1 x 3.6 inches . they are a little on the spendy side but what is n't now day 's . they are a very nice pan and wash up really easy . 
they do not have a non stick coating , but very easy to prep . cook evenly ... almost perfectly every time with an added benefit of a healthier option compared to a non stick product . 
yes 
sorry i have not tried high acid or gluten free bread mix in these pans . i have made lots of quick breads from scratch but none with a high acid content . 
yes 
actually this tray is not compatible with the ast420y stand . the base on the tripod of that stand is not wide enough and can cause a weight imbalance . however , it does fit ast422y and ast423y . both of these have a much sturdier and wider base . 
unfortunately this is not compatible with ast420y 
the height of the juicer is 15 1 2 inches the width is 12 inches the juice container is 1 liter hope this is fine 
blend to drink 
buy a different juicer i ignored reviews and bought it but the juicer kept getting pieces of black plastic flaking off.returned it . 
it plugs in electric outlet . it wastes too much of the fruit or vegetable . 
i bought a chefs star juicer , only three times , the last run only three minutes to stop moving , and now it has not been able to use , i suspect it is not good quality , perhaps my bad luck ? 
honestly i 'm not sure , i have never checked the voltage ... that would probably be a question for the manufacturer . 
two 
no . wheat grass requires a special blade in order for it to not come out stringy . 
i did n't get any instructions with it . maybe i 'm the only one who bought one . 
yes that is how i am using it on a metal bed frame . 
yes . there are mattress frames that remove the need for a box frame that work great . 
no . it 's delivered by ups . call a local goodwill . they might come get your old mattress . 
yes it was , but the mattress itself would be what i would call a medium support mattress . 
yes , of course . 
hi , it comes with one year warranty.we are using more than 5 months . it 's worth to buy it . 
it appears they are , they work great in my cuisinart coffee hot water maker . have been using these for about 5 months now , i change every 30 days i use coffee maker constantly . 
we first bought the cusinart filters from a specialty kitchen store and paid $ 10.00 for 2 filters . then i looked for them on amazon to get a better deal . the ones we bought on amazon were the exact same filter minus the fancy packaging . we got 15 filters for the price of the 2 from the specialty store . we got a great deal on amazon . each was individually wrapped just like the specialty store . 
as far as i know they will work in your coffee maker . 
they might , i 'm really not sure . 
if it looks like the same filter it will probably fit your coffee maker 
i have a twin & no loops 
it fit perfectly , i 'm totally loving it . 
better smaller 
do n't have a duvet . did n't even know what it was until i asked my wife & # 128563 ; 
it comfortably holds service for eight -- eight each of knives , dinner forks , salad forks , soup spoons and teaspoons . 
it does n't say anything specific about rusting . however , the finish seems like a thick coating so , i do n't think its stainless steel , or any similar material that might rust . that 's a guess on my part . i will say , it is nicer in person than the picture portrays . 
no . 
there are three . i like mine . i live in a small nyc apartmen and it 's perfect for my purposes : ) 
i 've used it for months in my dish drainer . clean , wet utensils go in it to dry . it 's fine and has n't rusted . sorry for the delayed response . i had n't been checking all my emails . 
8 '' long 2 3 4 '' wide 4 3 4 '' high 
yes 
this is a lot smaller than what you might think it is . i would have purchased two . here are the dimensions : across the front it 's roughly 7 1 2 inches . the height is approximately 4 1 2 inches and the depth is 2 1 2 inches . hope this helps . 
the exact height is 11-7 8 '' . ours is hung under the upper cab . if sitting on a counter , the height is 11-7 8 '' x 24 '' w . 
you guys are crazy nobody has answered it should be on the website ! ! ! how awful , , , , 
did you ever find the answer to your question ? i have the same issue . thanks . 
yes . 
yes , pem31dfww . 
no 
yes . very quiet unit and heats things well . good purchase . 
10 1 2 inches -- plenty big enough for most things 
i have not found it to be so . it may be but i did not want to force it . i just wipe it out carefully and it seems to work . 
there is a cancel button . 
it makes 4 small at one time . you can use the sticks or not . i like this waffler because the ears are indented . my grandfather always said butter and syrup in every hole so this is perfect ! 
i bought this for my son & daughter in law , my grandson is 1 1 2 yrs . old , they do n't use the sticks yet . my grandson loves mickey mouse , they even make blueberry waffles too ! 
i found some at smart and final . coffee stirrers . 
personally , i would only hand wash them . we hand wash all our beer glasses because the residual soap dishwashers leave can affect the beer taste and kill the head . 
i 'm unsure i ordered a full size 
no 
if you need something firm i would not recommend any memory foam . memory foam it is by nature not firm , but the opposite , it molds to your shape . sounds like a spring-based mattress would be more appropriate for you . 
it did smell a little after i took it out of the box . i did not put it on my bed for several days . the smell was gone by then . 
i would not suggest to do that . it is very dense . i 'm afraid it would lose its texture . 
80x60 standard queen size 
i have not personally , but i would think you could . i spiralized brocolli stocks , which did n't turn out great , but it still worked . i would also make sure i wore gloves as it could be really messy with beets ! 
3 blades . there are compartments on the side of it that holds them . its worth purchasing ! i love mine . 
in the top rack ... it should be fine . i had no problems washing mine there . i really love my spirooli . i just have to remember to reduce the size of my vegetables being spiroolied ! 
i believe this is the same item based on what i 've read on the following website . http : www.ultimate-weight-products.com h-wc-spiral.html 
it 's for the short way . potatoes do n't work well with this one from my experience . it works great for the softer veggies like squash and onions 
the tag says foam made in usa , pillow assembled in usa . 
yes , you can wash and dried in the machine no problem . 
these pillows are filled with shredded memory foam . in my opinion because of this , it is much more comfortable to sleep on than the solid foam . i have bought several of these pillows , so i have spares , that 's how great they are ! 
i would hope this question is for hotel life who is selling them below our actual cost even before amazon and shipping fees 
about 27 '' long and 16-17 '' wide . 
it looks high when you first get it . but , after sleeping on it a few times it goes down . had mine for a couple months now , and it settled to mid way between high and low . 
yes . you can unzip and wash . 
pakistan . 
yes , exactly . 
no zipper . it 's just a regular pillow case with a straight edge ; no fold over . 
maybe 2 '' fabric feels awful against your face . 
its just a duvet cover and pillow case . 
i put it in the washer and dryer 
i returned the item upon receiving it because it was very thin and i thought it was n't worth the price . i have sheets that are thicker and better quality . i do n't remember the thread count , but because i was planning on using sheets underneath my son 's duvet , i was n't too concerned with that . sorry i could n't be more help . 
i do not know the measurements off hand but they fit my kiddos ' twin beds like any other traditional twin size set . i bought the duvet twin comforter insert from ikea and it fits perfectly . i am pretty sure they list the measurements on their site . hope this helps ! 
yes if you can if there is elect power avaible . 
the bottom panel says `` made in china '' . 
it has a temp display ; however what it shows is the temp that you have set it to . not a display of the pan or food temp . hope that helps you ! it is a great device . dave 
14 '' l x 11 '' wide . fits in cabinet nicely . i use it a lot ! 
you have to use special cookware up to 12 '' 
the started soft . now are completely flat 
no , they do not have a bad smell at all . 
hello , these pillows have a medium firmness to them . 
i have no idea what they use but i cant smell anything on my pillows ... i would guess that the company who sells them would have all that enfo . for you thats my guess ... sorry 
sir , i 'm not sure unless a full size has a different supply & demand pricing to it . i paid $ 215 last june 2014 for the simple life fold in half solid flat foundation , which is just what i needed with the ultimate dreams memory foam mattress i paid $ 730 for a queen mattress for the ultimate dreams brand mattress & it went down now by $ 90 just since last june 2014. i see where a twin also cost more then a queen in price with the simple life foundation . perhaps someone that works there can answer your question better . i very much love my ultimate dreams mattress . it took me a while before settling for a great mattress after 2 months of researching & comparing memory foam . its just perfect comfort for me.take care 
i 'm not sure what you mean by that . this is a great product , i highly recoment it . 
yes it is it is well built 
just the foundation . you to to buy bed frame separately 
no it does n't ... 
yes , these mugs are lacquered which seems to resist tarnishing therefore maintaining a shiny finish longer than other moscow mule mugs i have seen . 
do n't know ... no manufacturing text on the mugs anywhere 
tag reads : 100 % polyester , machine wash cold gentle cycle with like colors , do not bleach , line dry . 
you cant see thru it so i used a 10.00 clear plastic one there are so many colors to match 
the leaves are a very real sage color , the other medallions are more of a muted aqua . 
there 's no red . the darker color that looks like red is a really dark pink color . 
no it does n't , some viewers said it does , but mine did not . and it 's not waterproof , so you will need a inside liner , i thought it was and mine mildewed a little on bottom . : ( it looks nice hanging though . i also bought the curved rod from amazon and it turned out nice ! 
yes : ) 
hi . i do n't know what 'european style ' butter is but i can give this description of the dish . it is considered oversized in that the plate part is wider than most you 'd find . the lid bows out slightly on the sides so it is a bit wider . it clears a quarter stick by far but is not tall or wide enough to fit a whole pound of butter . it is best suited for only a quarter pound stick and being oversized is really just for being decorative and sturdy . hope that helps ! 
about 3-1 4 to 3-1 2 '' 
not wide enough 
yes , it does . 
no it does not come with hooks but it is a nice curtain durable . 
you will need 36 hooks and open hooks over the rod will work best . 
the one i have is a standard shower curtain height but is 180 inches wide . 
a bunch - 32 : ) 
about this item extra wide shower curtain for a clawfoot tub opaque with magnets approximately 180 '' wide 70 '' long extra wide to keep the water and heat in opaque in color to let the light in can be used as a liner or the curtain itself 33 stainless grommets 
they 're lined but not insulated . 
yes 
yes 
they are metal ... ..so depending on how you would hold the handle would determine if it would be too hot to hold ! i have not tried hot drinks ... only use for cold ! not sure if something hot would make the copper change color ? ! ? sorry , do not have a definitive answer for you . 
there is no dark spot . that is just a reflection . the cups are beautiful ! 
no they are n't but they are great ! we love them . easy to carry hold and keep your drink colder at the end than at the beginning . 
california 
this set of mugs is 16ounces each -- the perfect size for a moscow mule . i find that the 20 ounce mugs are just a smidge too big . fill to just under half with ice and then add -- 1 2 ounces fresh lime juice , 2 ounces vodka and then 5.5 ounces ginger beer . give it a mix and serve . if you 're feeling crazy , add a sprig of mint . : ) i ca n't even count how often i 've used these mugs since i got them a couple months ago . they are great . 
the perfect size for a moscow mule ! and easy to hold in your hand ... .unlike some i ordered from another site ... . they looked like soup bowls . these are perfect ! 
from kitchenaid live chat customer service : `` all of the plastic on that electric kettle is bpa free . the dual wall construction keeps heat in while leaving the outside surface cool to the touch . the interior wall is plastic bpa free coated to protect the interior from mineral buildup . '' 
kitchenaid give this product a one year warranty . 
no 
my son checks it before he makes his coffee and it is 212 degrees . i love this kitchenaid pot . i used to use a regular stove top tea kettle , this is much better . 
hi . it is not exposed . thanks 
1500w 
china 
the box is like 4ft tall and pretty heavy abt 60 lbs . you def need to air it out for about a week . 
have had the mattress since december 2013 and there has been no need to do anything to it except launder the sheets ! i love this mattress it took about a month to get used to feeling like i was laying on a rock ( because it is so supportive ) but now it just feels good to crawl in ! i suspect once a year or maybe twice i may vacuum it and rotate it but as of right now there is no need to do that but old habits do die hard ! 
no 
no 
hi krissy , the peeler is made in china . best regards joe kenny 
i have n't tried it on zucchini yet but yes the carrots came out nice and long . i would not cut the top of the carrot until i use it ( just to have some way to hold them ) unless their tips are better . i have n't read their tips yet , but again despite all that the carrots came out fine . 
i do n't really know , but it is super easy to wash it ! i just put it under the sink 's faucet and use a kitchen brush if is necessary 
yes 
i 've seen it suggested that , because these blades are so sharp , it is best to hand wash to retain the sharpness . 
not that i know of .

hello mary you will still need to put out a vent in the window . thanks 
i have n't measured it but it is about 6 ft when stretched out . you need to keep it as short as possible since it gets hot and will radiate heat that offsets the cooling effect . i 'm actually looking for an insulation wrap for it . mine will only cool a small room . i actually got it to use in a tent . 
no , not yet . 
yes , work well for that size . 
the unit itself does not . the exhaust tube that comes off the back does however . it needs somewhere for the heat and moisture it pulls from the air to go . 
yes 
sounds like the compressor is shutting on and off in relation to the the unit 's set temperature and the room temperature . this is normal for the air conditioner 's compressor to shut on and off . it is a feature of the air conditioner that will help conserve energy . 
it was the second highest rated in consumer reports . i really like it . light weight but heavy duty when vacuuming the carpet and bare floors . 
the power head has 4 different height levels from hardwood to carpet , it does come with a small brush head which attaches to the main handle , separate from the power head 
yes a button reels it into the machine - works great ! by the way i love everything about this machine 
sorry brenda , not able to find where it 's made . not listed on the vacuum or in the accompanying paperwork . ( think if it was made in the usa , it would be proudly stated somewhere ) just says , `` manufactured for sears brands management corp . 1-800-4my-home . '' i can say that i was a tough sell when buying vacuums because i want something what works well on all levels of my home and is n't a `` toy '' . this vacuum has incredible suction both through the power head and the attachments . no matter how clean my house appears before i begin , i always have a remarkable amount of dust and hair in the dust canister when i 'm finished . the cord length is great and it 's relatively light for carrying up the stairs . i keep the attachments in a small tote bag because the clips that they provide to keep them on the handle just seem awkward and get bumped when vacuuming under the beds or in tight areas . ( my previous canister had a storage compartment but this bagless style does n't have one ) . 
you can find replacement parts on the itouchless website . 
naturally , it depends on what you put into the trash receptacle as to how bad the odor is or how bad it will get . we replace our filters about every 3 months and get along real well the odor control . 
it 's 42 inches high . 
1 inch ... but really strong . 
this table does come with 2 legs . thank you for your inquiry . beyond stores . 888-349-6096 
i put it on a trundle bed ( the top-too deep for the bottom pull out ) . it is the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in ! 
i do n't recall what sort of warranty it has . it has been awhile since i purchased it . i still love it ! 
yes but be careful when removing it , the seam that attaches to the zipper tore on mine . you have to be really careful zipping it up . 
honestly it was ready to go within the hour . most amazing purchase ive ever made . the only complaint i have now is that i sleep too late haha , but really . 
moderately firm 
they say it does , but the problem is it swells to full size when you open it , and how would you ship it back , it took a couple of weeks but i like it now , it still is hard to get out of , in that you will sink into it and you have to pull yourself out . 
40.8 lb 's . it 's vaccumed packed . 
yes , it does . that is the beauty . it indicates that it keeps the beverage chillingly refreshing . 
i do n't think so . you could try but it may ruin the cup 
it is one mug . 
lisa , thank you for the question . for this mug we are not planning a hammered mug version . but soon we will be introducing 100 % copper hammered mug . 
do n't remember for certain but think they 're made in usa . they are a very good quality i can assure you . i really am pleased with them . 
it 's envelope style but in addition there are ties that keep it fastened . 
hi again jennifer the shams do not include the pillow inners regards taffy 
sorry , i only bought the euro shams . no idea on the rest of the sizes . 
thanks for your interest in our product . the euro is 26 '' x26 '' . 
yes 
yes it is , the problem i had with this item was it retained to much heat . 
just one ( 1 ) . the quality is excellent but the price is pretty steep . you can pay a fraction of the price for a bpa free cover at bed bath and beyond but the quality is not the same . plus the one at bbb has a smaller cover included as well . i think the price was under $ 10 . 
since it is essentially plastic , i would n't try it . 
hi there . , yes the material is bpa free . this is why it 's a little higher in price than our competitors . happy christmas 
hi . i do n't think it is . let me check with my manufacturer 
not at all . i 've noticed no residual flavor from the container . these really are the best purchase i 've even made on amazon . i got exactly what i wanted . they 're durable , seal completely and securely , they do n't stain and they do just fine in the dishwasher on a heat setting . you will be happy with your purchase . the different sizes are convenient and theses feel like they 'll last a life time . 
i 've never seen the qvc lock and lock but these are thick durable plastic . the locking clips are secure . i 'd drop this full of wine on a white carpet and not bat an eye . great quality product . 
yes , they stack perfectly on the shelf and take up very little space . they actually for inside of one another . 
yes , definitely ! 
the blue light at the base of the unit will change color and let you know when your filter must be replaced . how long a filter will last depends on the amount of minerals etc . in your water . 
it claims to take some out , which is better than none ( see most others ) , but this brand was a great source of disappointment for me . i returned it 3 different times because eventually it would leak out from the bottom . because of the fluoride filtering , i kept giving it another chance . the customer service was very nice and they kept replacing it . after my 4th filter ( which lasted the longest ) started the slow and eventual heavy leaking , i gave up . which i had better news . still searching . 
base is 4.5 '' wide , 15 '' deep and 12 '' tall . add another inch in depth with pitcher . pitcher handle extends past front of base . 
i looked all over as that is what i would really rather have also . i could n't find anything saying that it did . 
no , it 's plastic . 
no idea ! go to the aquasana website and see if you can find the information there . if not , give them a call , they 'd be happy to answer any questions you may have . 
i do n't know . i have already returned it to costco . i had other issues with it and will update my review . 
hi laurel , the dimensions are from large to small . 10x5 , 9x4 , 8 1 2x4 1 2 , 8x4 . i love them . they look beautiful and hold so much in each size . debbie m . 
thank you for your inquiry yes the consistents work for flour tea coffee sugur ... ... .etc 
hi donna , the canisters just have a seal along the edge . they are not air tight . the lids fit loosely on each one . i keep pre made coffee filters in them for the week and they always stay fresh and perfect . i love them so much and they look beautiful . i hope this helps a bit . debbie 
it can be used as decorative shower curtain for simple styles modern bathroom or protective liner for your fabric or cotton shower curtains . it is light color..wo n't affect your own decorative curtains ! ! 
it is using pvc free material . lw-07 is 100 % eva . no bad smell and health concerns . 
it is plastic , it will melt if you use an iron . however , mine was not wrinkled . 
it 's plastic , not fabric . better off hosing it down if necessary . 
this lw-07 shower curtain does not have magnets at the bottom . it works well with other decorative shower curtain outside . and it is not easy to flow away because it is heavier than most thin shower curtain liners . 
yes you would . i use them in the freezer . the only thing is it may be hard to get the label off once you use them in the freezer . 
cinthya , this is anthony wayne , founder of chalky talky . the answer is yes , you can wash them in the sink without removing them and they will stick . with that said , we do wash these labels on jars at our home , but not in a commercial setting . i am not sure if you are washing multiple times a day how long they would stick . however , if you do go ahead with it and they do not last to your needs , please drop me a line and i will reimburse you . it would be interesting to know that data . i have a feeling they will outperform expectations , even in commercial use . that would make for a great review ( hint , hint : ) ! 
there are 3 different designs in the package -- 12 of each 
real chalk , i really like them ! 
the only thing i can say os that , i use them on mason jars and they did not leave any glue residue when i take them off so i dont think it can damage clothing 
i tried it and it works i could take it off with out leaving any residue , but i dont know what would happen in the long run 
my husband uses the juicer and says it 's a breeze to clean . all the veggie peels rinse right off . 
a voltage converter would adjust for that , however the frequency ( hz ) that the power grid runs from could be the issue . for example the us electric supply runs at 60hz , but the uk runs at 50hz . while this is n't a problem for small or static devices , it will likely pose a problem for kinetic appliances , such as the juicer in this case . what will happen is that the motor can not run at full power , as it tries to draw energy at a faster rate than can be provided by the grid , and this eventually kills the motor off . you could look into a voltage and frequency adaptor , but these are bulky and expensive . my suggestion would be to buy local to ensure a longer product life . ( sorry for all the babble , i hope it came across clear enough ! ) 
yes it does 
yes it did . the book was great , but unfortunately , the booster blender broke after about 10 uses . : 
it is my first juicer . i really like it . it works well , and cleans up quickly . i use it everyday . friends who have other juicers envy mine . 
yes it is . although i lay my rack on its side because it is too tall for my shelf . it will hold my cast iron on its side and also when i put the shelf upright too . 
they are 3 '' wide . also , unless you want to screw the rack into the cabinet , just lay it on it 's side . i have very heavy pans , and it would tip over every time i would take one out , so i just put it on its side and slid the pans in , and it works perfectly , and gives you an extra space to add another pan or lids . 
probably not . my thick frying pot wo n't fit . 
it is about 12 inches tall . 
yes ! very nice quilt for ) $ $ . very soft and not too thin . great quality 
yes it does . 
it 's been a while since i bought this so i do n't know the dimensions but it was a fairly good sized box . the king is a very big quilt , i love mine and use it every fall and winter ! 
right now , no , but i have contacted escali which is the manufacturer and they said they are weeks away from releasing it , so it will be very soon 
no . the application does n't have scanning capabilities . you can search the item and view more information on the nutritional facts 
yes , you can use any box spring ! 
i do n't know . we kept our box springs and put plywood between them and new mattress . sorry 
it seems to go pretty fast , 10 minutes would be about 90-95 % expanded i 'd say 
absolutely ! i use the largest of the three for this purpose regularly . 
it does n't say and i threw out the package it came in . it only had a small sticker on the handle . maybe if you click on northern lights usa inc they can tell you where it 's made . they 're the ones it 's sold by ! 
no , the mesh is the same 'grade ' on all three ... i would say that it 's on the fine side , but not super fine . super helpful , right ? : ) 
they fit in the top of a wide mouth jar but there is a small gap so i have found if you pour slowly it prevents anything from getting around the strainer . also the small fits perfect on the smaller mouthed jars and jelly jars . 
it is very fine mesh , i use when i make soup and it strains everything out but the broth . 
i 've done it - so i guess it 's safe to do . i think it would depend upon how long you hold the strainer over boiling water . it 's stainless steel so i think it would hold up for time to steam your vegetables . these are my favorite strainers and i use them for so much ! probably more than they were intended for ! give it a go - try it with a small one first just to check it out . have fun ! ( i love steamed vegetables , too ! ) 
just a single layer 
the largest one has a depth of about 1-3 4 inch , the middle one about 1-1 4 inch , and the smallest one about 3 4 inch . these are approximate as there is no way to measure without a depth gauge . they are relatively shallow , but extremely well made and serviceable . the mesh is fine enough for me to use it for sifting small seeds and flour . i would buy them again , if i needed to replace them . 
the mesh part is about 2 inches across . 
no but it was pretty easy to put together ! 
the top with the leaves folded down is 14.5 '' x 14.5 '' . 
eating a snack yes , having an entire meal , i would n't recommend . it 's not very sturdy so not sure how much wear and tear it could handle . 
maybe 15 or 20 lbs 
no it is about 1 inch off of what it says 
24mm x 24mm , 40mm deep from the front of the slot ; 50mm from the back of the slot as the top is slanted 
lipstick holders size - 24mm x 24mm , 40mm deep from the front of the slot ; 50mm from the back of the slot as the top is slanted 
it is hard plastic . it 's like the cosmetic display stands at the local drug store . the draws does n't come out smoothly , but i do n't really use it much . it 's really convenient ! great way to keep the makeup organizes and visible . 
norway ok ! shipping is available . 
canada , delivery is possible . thank you 
the color of the finish is select cherry which is a darker somewhat red finish with some brown in it . the are three adjustments for the 2 shelves behind the glass doors . there is one adjustable shelf behind the middel door also . 
yes but i would not buy it again ... . mine is a piece of garbage that is coming apart i have contacted sauder and they try to send me different replacement parts but really who wants to take it apart and flip it over and put in extra parts that it 's really just a bad made piece of furniture . the side wood pushes out and the shelves come apart and i 've never moved it and treat it like gold ... try to find something else so you do n't waste the money 
yes it does . 
1500 watts 120 volts 
the etl logo from the us is shown on the box in which the heater was shipped . that is the only indication i could find . i did not see a ul logo or mark . 
the 980 has a few more features than the 970 ( 2 available temperature settings , etc ) . if you pull up the specifications for each you should see a couple more listed for the 980. we went with the 970 because it was more affordable and worked perfectly for our needs . 
sorry , i do n't recall . ( my guess would be it 's 970 . ) in the overall scheme of things , the small differences you 're asking about , would probably not be noticeable with this unit . 
i do n't know how that product works but my honeywell works extremely well and is energy efficient i would use any other heater because this honeywell does everything i need a portable heater to do and it does well in large rooms to ! 
it is about 14 ild 
this ultimate sleep topper -- `` queen talalay latex mattress pad topper '' is indeed manufactured using the talalay method . 
yes it is 
yes 
i was unable to find your blender model anywhere online including cuisinart.com , so i can not determine if this blade is compatible . but considering the high number of negative reviews regarding the quality of this blade ( mine included ) , i recommend avoiding it even if it does fit ; buy it from cuisinart instead . 
i do not know , but there are a few excellent appliance parts websites that help you find the answer . 
no 
if your blender is the smart power classic spb-6 the blade should be compatible 
yes , it works great ! ! 
yes it is according to the cuisinart website 
it all depends on your model of blender . this one fit ours , but only lasted two weeks before it shattered . 
400 pound by their literature . 
the blip care units will still save the information but ca n't be seen until uploaded and need an internet connection to upload . in other words you weigh yourself on a blipcare scale or take your blood pressure on their monitor when you have no internet connection , you will see the value on the scale meter but it will not upload and be stored for analysis until your unit has internet access . 
i do n't think so . i do n't have a fitbit . the tech level of this scale is lower monotone , not higher complex with some options for network connections . i love the scale though ! it 's great to have the graphs and bmi on the account page . you 'll love it . 
we are approaching the app developers to see if they would allow us to integrate . 
about 17 inches 
chair at widest point is about 4.5 inches but back arches so takes up just over 7 inches if you imagine wall to widest point . add a few inches as well because it must lean against so thing or topple over . when stacked they do not take up much room . you can view same similar chair at bed bath and beyond but cheapest on amazon . 
black 
i guess it would be possible . you would have to pry the seat off and it seems pretty secure . 
yes - every now and then , but probably not on an everyday basis . it 's a nice chair , sturdy , attractive , and great for that occasional big dinner party . 
yes ready to use 
17 inches at the front and 14 1 2 inches at the back 
yes 
chairs are very strong , you wo n't be disappointed . 
at least 200 # , likely close to 300 # . they have held up well for family gatherings . 
i would think they 'd be great . my son does n't have a glass top stove but i do at home and use similar cookware . that 's why i bought him this . anyway , they 're very flat on the bottom which is what we need with glass tops . 
this set is triply . i love it . 
yes it is induction safe . although i did return my set . we found that it had some nice design features , but found the set to be too light weight and found the set with a couple of dents upon delivery . 
the only markings i see on them say emril 
the set is designed by not manufactured by all-clad . 
the crackle template that you peel and mount to the wall has markings for two screws . the hammer hangs from those two screws , love it . -- jack 's dad 
3d light fx 
it takes 3 aa alkaline batteries . 
depends how long you leave it on . if you leave it on all night , probably a couple of weeks . it gets dimmer as the batteries die . 
since i only turn it on at night , i guess couple of months 
yes , it was installed on a blue wall and looked great . 
the hammer is light weight and held on with screws and raw plugs . the screws are not extremely long however is quite sturdy . hope this helps : ) 
belgin , it makes a very deep waffle . i had the regular oster maker i got yrs ago and you really ca n't even compare the two . 
i agree with bonnie in that it does n't need any coating . i use krusteaz waffle mix which uses a little vegetable oil in the batter . 
the diameter is approximately 8 inches . 
yes 
it 's a 1000w appliance w a continuous adjustment dial , but i cook mostly at less than halfway to maximum . you should size your breaker or inverter to the maximum wattage . 
unfortunately , no it does not . 
31 '' wide exactly : ) 15 1 2 '' deep ( front to back ) 
hello , thank you for your question . we only have 3-bag laundry sorter now . it will have bigger room than sorter with 4 bags . and if we have 4-bag laundry sorter later , we will tell you about that . have a nice day . 
yes 
20.5 '' back height 17 '' front height 13 '' front to back 8 '' wide left to right 
no they can not be locked 
i checked - the label said `` do not wash. wipe with damp cloth . ''

you definitely need two bags 
that 's a great question . we 're the first company in america to blend both recycled and oxo bio degradable additives to make our eco mattress protective cover . we take recycled films and shrink wrapped commonly found wrapping pallets of goods shipped to large super markets and retail centers and clean , polish and then chop and reform this into the base of the eco mattress bag . then we add a non toxic oxo bio component and form the bag . yesterday , we won the sustainable business council of los angeles green product and business of the year with our innovate and eco friendly solution to protecting your mattress ! thanks for a great question ! spence brown , founder and chief tree hugger , rent a green box and eco mattress bags ! 
eco mattress bags are sealed with tape and can also be repaired with clear tape if you tear , rip or need extra reinforcement for really old mattresses that have bolded on plastic corner caps . 
all of our eco mattress bags are made with 2.2 mil non vented professional grade recycled plastic . our eco bag is designed to be the toughest mattress protective cover made in america ! ! 
i do n't recall what the packaging says , but i 've put mine in the dishwasher a number of times . they retained their shape and still work just fine . 
19 1 2 '' w x 12 1 4 '' h x 20 '' d 
according to the product details it weighs 57 lbs . 
my window is 30 '' and the side panel are not fully extended so it seems likely . 
they are in the discription . product dimensions : 19.4 x 19.6 x 12.4 inches ; 57 pounds 
well the window would have to be at least 20 inches that would give you 1 2 inch to squeeze it in and i measured the max , is 31 '' but the specs say 36 '' 
60f 
the manual says it will fit in a window as small as 22 inches wide and 13 inches high . my window is 23 inches wide and with both guide panels installed it just fit . 
yes , it has an energy saver feature that does exactly that . 
yes , but it must be a heavy duty or industrial strength cord . 
as i mention in my review , while the bottom of the interior is stainless steel the sides of the interior are all plastic . it 's not obvious at first , and i can see why some people did n't notice , but about 70 % of the interior is plastic . if you do n't want toxic chemicals from plastic leaching in to your boiling water than i suggest that you avoid this kettle . 
i would recommend not doing so . i had a european one that i brought to the states . it died on me within a few months . find one for the 220v and buy that one . 
the reason we went for this one was the construction . we were tired of buying one electric kettle a year - plus having the no longer functioning one to add to the landfill or try to recycle . so far , i think we 've had this about 2 years and it is as good as the day we got it . if you are n't really looking for anything that can calibrate temp to the type of tea , boiling water on a hot plate , or even ( i mean , if you just want it hot ) heating in a microwave , or on a stove top works fine . we drink alot of teas and a lot of different kinds of tea , so having that feature works very well for us . 
no it does not . you just have to push the button on again and in few seconds or minutes , your temperature will at the right temperature again . 
no 
hi deborah , as i said in my review the full kettle set to the highest temperature takes 6 minutes to come to a full boil . lesser amounts of water or lower temperature settings will take a shorter time . i do n't know if geographic location is an issue for you . i am located about in the middle of the united states . judy 
i do n't see why not ! it is the same as any other kettle inside - i love mine - best kettle ever . 
it is mdf construction 
the doors come from the factory with pre-drilled holes to match the hinges and where they attach to the sides . i suppose you could drill your own sets of holes if you wanted to open them the other way . 
thank you for your question . the dimensions are 15 x 15 x 63 inches . thanks for looking ! home wishes 
this does require assembly 
it is about 5'4 '' 
no it does not , the material is very smooth so i do n't think if you paint it , it 'll look good . 
product dimensions : 15 x 15 x 63 inches ; 48 pounds 
it depends on how much your cookie dough spreads - whether your cookies are mounds or flat . a cookie sheet with interior space measurements of 10 '' x15 '' will fit 4 across by 3 down . hope this helps . 
it has rechargeable ni-cad batteries , so repeated charging before the batteries are depleted will cause the `` memory effect '' , shortening the life-span . 
no 
yes you can replace the battery but it costs almost the same as buying a new unit . 
no 
i do n't know about cats , but it picks up the hair of my dog when i clean my car . 
not any noisier than all their others . let me tell you though . it 's a piece of junk . not like they were when they first came out . very small diet holder , nowhere to put accessory parts , loses suction fast and is mostly like a kid 's toy . do n't buy it and if you did , bring it back . i did . 
product dimensions : 33 x 14 x 14 inches ; 10 pounds is the super vac product dimensions : 33 x 14 x 14 inches ; 11 pounds proteam vac so yes is the answer 
yes , with hard for attachments . 
i am not sure u think it has a 5 year warranty . i will say we use ours everyday at work , and i am about to order one for my home . 
yes it is 
not quite sure of the exact length ( maybe 7 feet ? ) , but the wand is quite long and has a downward curve toward the floor ( i.e. , it 's not a straight wand as on consumer vacuums ) . the length is not adjustable . tall people will have absolutely no issues with the wand length . for shorter people , it may feel a little awkward , but the performance of the vacuum , which is amazing , makes up for it . on edit : the wand is actually about 5 or so feet in vertical height and probably around 6 feet or so in total length , including the curve . 
i use them for egg muffins , and have n't been brave enough to try it without a spray of pam in each cup . i hate scrubbing eggs off of pans , so these are excellent . the egg muffins fall right out . however , these silicone pans are flimsy and need to be supported by another cookie sheet underneath to transfer from the counter to the oven . 
this muffin pan is thick and sturdy enough to stand directly on the oven rack but not as rigid as a metal pan . it will bend a little between the cups so you 'll want to make sure each row of cups is on the rack . hope that helps . 
simple home creations is based in the us . this product manufactured in china . 
i want to say the slightest little bit , but please save yourself the trouble and buy another brand . i got these , opened them and the went right in the trash ! waste of money . full of splinters ! 
i do n't know if they are usa made . but they are certainly durable and worth the price . 
i 'm pretty sure the package said to hand wash them . 
the set i received is unfinished . 
no 
yes ... the whole thing is quite tiny , but perfect for a tea tasting as i do frequently with my elementary school students ... they love it ! 
it is a forty pound hopper . it is a little tight , but it will hold 1 full bag of pellets . 
no . but it 's pretty easy to rig up a battery back up with a small inverter and a car boat battery . 
$ 239 a ton at home depot . 
no , it is a pellet stove only . 
2 watts you are only powering a small fan which uses very little power 
yes it is thank you great stove 
go to the manufacturer 's website and download the owner 's manual . there is a diagram in the manual that provides dimensions for the pad and the clearance requirements . http : www.castlestoves.com foundations store shopdetail.asp ? params=12327 & tab=docs 
10 lbs 
i really think they do n't get much hotter than my other dishes . they are heavy and so beautiful and we enjoy them , i maybe crazy but i think the food tastes better , their beautiful . we want to purchase another set . enjoy them ! ! ! ! 
china 
the ones i have are black . 
hello , thank you for your question . the washing instructions are to machine wash on cold , separately and on a gentle cycle . you are able to tumble dry but do not iron . unfortunately i do not know if this item is reversible . i hope this helps ! 
i just washed mine and it washes up great ... just remember to change your water lever to small or medium because it does not soak up a lot of water and will cause your washer to overflow . ..i learned that the hard way . it is a great set just not as warm as i thought it would be but will be great with the weather warming up . love it ! 
yes it does , they also include plastic lids for storage . love this grinder , use it frequently ! 
i 'm sorry i do not know as mine is still sitting in the box , but i did buy it to make cookie butter , just have n't gotten a chance to do it yet . 
i like it but , i take mine to almost fine , so not sure it can be controlled , to do coarse or fine , it does not have an adjustment on it . but , it does grind it very well , and came with 2 extra cups to interchange , spices , herbs ? 
yes i can . i love it 
blades are very sharp stainless ... the rest is plastic ... easy to use and store . 
even though i have a dishwasher i often wash the set by hand . it 's no more dangerous than any other grater cutter.. i have never cut myself washing it ( although i did julienne my finger when cutting a carrot one time - my fault ) . just be sure to make all your washing strokes in the opposite direction from the one you would use when cutting and you should be fine . 
yes , that is what the box says ! 
yes they are . i would recommend putting them on the top shelf only . 
this particular product only comes in one size . 
sure it should work fine 
china 
yes , but the cheese should be cold and preferably a harder cheese . the apples turn out perfectly ! 
the strainer is only used if you want a thicker , `` greek '' style yogurt . you can opt to not use it and just eat the yogurt as is , with the whey . 
i use an electronic digital one . i heat the milk in the microwave at 1 min intervals . it probably takes about 10 mins . but i have n't actually timed . i decrease the heating time as the temp nears 185 . 
probably about 2 cups . you will have a lot of whey if you strain it for 2 hours . you can always forgo the straining and have about 4 cups of regular yogurt 
it comes with 2 containers- large 7.5 cup and small 6.75 cups . this may be the difference . 
plastic 
yes . there is trap that covers the straw hole to secure it . 
yes , the straw is not water tight ( for obvious reasons ) , so it will leak both around the straw and through the straw itself . 
i have their metal containers for hot beverages . i would n't use it for hot beverages for 2 reasons : first , if they do n't melt the plastic , they would n't maintain their heat ; and second , you 'd probably burn your hand . i 'm sure they are meant solely for non-hot liquid . their metal containers keep liquids hot for more than an hour ! 
yes it does . 
yes , it bends just fine , but it 's a thick piece of foam , and it 's natural tendency is to straighten and fill out . 
this is a mattress topper . ca n't imagine it would be comfortable without a mattress . 
do you mean , `` does it fit the mattress ? '' after a few hours the foam fully expanded to a thick 2 inches . my mattress pad fit the bed perfectly on the sides , maybe just a tad small , but the sheets hold it nicely . 
i believe it 's 5 years and only will cover if a fault in craftsmanship . 
follow the link below : http : www.overstock.com home-garden 62-inch-urban-blend-ash-grey-media-tower 8379052 product.html 
this product is made with high-grade mdf and durable laminate . 
it is not solid wood . it 's particle board like most all tv stands in this price range . thus far i have n't noticed any longevity issues ( though i have n't had it for more than a few months ) and it seems like it will last longer than the stand it replaced . 
22 '' 
that big space there ? that 's where you put your dvd player , dvr , cable box , or game consoles . and that hole in that back of the space is where you feed the wires of those things to plug them into the wall or power strip so they are out of sight . 
snow cone has a three to five year shelf life . no refrigeration needed . one of the most shelf stable items you can purchase . 
it is ready to use . just need ice and cups 
no you will need to order one 
you usually only put about and ounce and a half of syrup to a 6 ounce cone ... ..a gallon is 144 ounces ... you can figure that you can get from 70 to 100 per gallon of flavoring ... .dont water it down ... .it will ruin the flavor 
depending on how big the cups are . 
no they are not sugar free ... ..i too do not like sugar free and these definitely are not ! 
no nuts , no eggs . 
no ... .super comfortable and has reduced my morning aches . 
yes it does . but , i have hard time getting bottom sheet to fit . 
no , i 'm pretty sure the cover is not waterproof but it immediately made a difference sleeping and waking up ache and pain free . 
15 '' high x 15 '' wide x 18.5 '' 
i have n't had tearing issues . i have had mine about 9 months and i still love it : ) going to bed is a comfy experience ! 
yes , you can use an electric blanket . make sure you purchase with the waterproof cover which has deep pockets and will cover your entire mattress and topper . 
it sits on top of the mattress 
i still have the box it was shipped in , which measures exactly 11.5 in . in width , 24 in . in height , and 28 inches in length . i am a 5 ft , 6 in . female and i had a difficult time carrying it by myself up a flight of stairs . 
the arm heights are adjustable but not low enuf for me ( 5ft3in ) ... it does n't bother my wife who 's the same height so go figure ... 
tried it with and without , found i prefer with sheets . without sheets , i was using a sleeping bag but the pad still got dirty over time . with sheets , it was kept clean . but be sure and use the `` deep '' pocket fitted sheets , because you 're adding 4 '' to the depth of your mattress . 
i 'm not sure of the weight , but it was heavy for me as i am72 yrs . old and stand 4ft.8in . but for a man it might not be that much . all i know is i love my topper and would never part with it . it has helped my hip pain and my hips do n't hurt any more . 
yes , i have had mine since september . i absolutely love it . 
it has a large cotton cover pad that goes all the way around the mattress . cheers 
the top layer can be washed in a machine and the gel foam does need cleaning unless you spill something and then you just rinse it out in your shower and hang to dry . very easy ! 
it is not the correct lid for 12 '' techef frying pan . 12 '' lid is currently out of stock . it will be available soon . 
i do n't know about that specific style , but that lid fits on the 11 inch techef art pan i bought . 
the torch and fuel are separate items . it 's available at any kitchen store . 
no , the fuel lasts a long time - but i use it periodically . it 's easy to refill . 
there is a push button on the back end of the torch . it also has a toggle switch to control the heat of the flame . 
it is very white ... a blue tint , typical led fashion . there is a difference in brightness from the low to high , but the color is not effected . if you are looking for a soft warm yellow , led is not the direction to go . the light is great for reading . 
no 
the instructions only say that charging time should not exceed 24 hrs . 
cable can be replaced by a generic cable . 
it seems to work as the instructions describe , 8 hours on low , 4 hours on high . http : www.dpled.com en proinfo.asp ? proid=2041 
technically `` yes '' but the cord is only about 18 inches long . so it would depend on the type of use , you 'd have to position the lamp . however the cord is removable , so after charging it you can place the lamp basically anywhere . that was the feature i liked best . 
its 90v - & gt ; 240v ... i think u can use in any country 
the base is 5x3x1 and when it is folded down it is very small at 5x3x2 so the base basically stays the same the entire time . hope this helps . 
hi tina , the spatulas are manufactured in china . hope this helps . regards , matt - starpack team member 
hi dustin , yes the spatulas are bpa free . no plastics , just 100 % food grade silicone . hope this helps . regards , matt - starpack team

no 
these are the same on both sides 
due the varied array of detergent 's , salt concentration and water types there is the possibility of light spotting on the spoons when run through the dishwasher , therefore we recommend hand washing only . 
no , you can keep the ring on at all times . 
i have put them in the dishwasher several times with no issues . 
the measuring spoons are originally made to our specification by a large and very well respected manufacturer in china . we spent many months finding the right supplier for this product and have been delighted with the results . hope this helps . 
yes , the measurements are engraved onto the stainless steel so they will never fade . 
yes , you can remove the ring and hang the spoons on a hook , the hole is 7mm wide and 12mm long 
lifetime guarantee 
yes , they are made of stainless steel and will not corrode . 
yes , just pull out the drawer and empty it . 
& lt ; 30 % is where you 'll see 10-15 degree decreases in your room . when humidity gets over 60 % , evap coolers stop working , and in fact can increase the temperature by pumping in hotter , more humid air . at 50 % humidity , you 'll only get 2-5 degree decreases . with a smaller unit like this , i doubt that you 'll notice anything above 50 % . right now in slc , ut , it just rained . humidity is about 53 % . i can feel cool air coming out of the unit , but it does n't travel more than 5-10 ft from the unit . when the humidity is the normal 20-25 % , this thing blows frigid air and cools my 200 sq ft room quite well . 
yes it folds flat with all four panels together for storage . the panels can also be flush with each other if you want a flat picture wall..just have to balance it so it does n't fall over . i 'm very happy with this piece , btw . 
it is canvas so it likely will not block much sound ... .definitely block whatever it 's in front of 
thank you for your interest in our product . unfortunately , furnituremaxx ship to lower 48 state in united sates only . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
i would not trust it to be waterproof . i would try a store like rei for waterproof spray 
i could n't findbone so i made one . went to joanns and bought fabric for $ 10 and used the orange one that came w ironing board as a pattern for the new one . it took less than an hour to make the new one . 
if you look closely at the ladder part of the board , you see 4 black rubber cushions ... that opens up into a vee and walla an ironing board . 
yes

dear william , the size of the over the sink dish drainer rack is 5 '' high , 11 3 4 '' wide and extends from 13 3 4 '' to 21 '' long . 
the basket is 14 '' long , 11.5 '' wide and 5 '' deep . the frame of the basket which hangs above the sink is 16 '' minimum and extends to 20.5 '' maximum . 
i 'm not sure . i do n't think that the product is made in china ; i believe that it was made in the us . to be frank , i try to avoid products made in china . the sink has worked out well for me , as it 's adjustable . no rust . it was what i needed to organize my kitchen better and to break myself of the habit of leaving items in the dish tray too long . hope that this helps . 
i 've had mine about 8 months and it has not rusted . i do n't know if it can go in the dishwasher , have just wiped mine down . 
dear cindy thompson , thank you for your recent inquiry . the over the sink dish drainer rack is stainless steel . we hope this information has been helpful . 
dear cindy thompson , thank you for your recent inquiry . you are correct , the width will remain at 11 3 4 '' while the length extends from 13 3 4 '' to 21 '' . 
they are velcoed on-easy to clean but they stay put . 
it is a popular upholstery material , it is a natural leather material . 
for me it was perfect . not too soft or too firm ; i like a little firmness because i have trouble with my right hip . if the bed is too soft it causes my hip and lower back to ache because there is n't enough support . my husband and i really like this pad a lot . hope this is helpful . 
i stay hot at night the feather bed burnt me up . we purchased this memory foam and it is a lot cooler than feather bed . it 's very comfortable no heat retention . 
do n't think so . it bottoms out on a mattress when you use your elbow to turn over . 
i have no idea where the topper was manufactured . 
there is no cover , just the foam . 
yes ... but you should replace the gaskets on each canning cycle ... . 
yes 
it is glass ... there is no such thing as bpa in glass ... only plastic and resins ... the gasket is bpa free 
yes , it 's bpa free 
no , it 's fully manual 
no it is not . i bought it for our pool house . it 's thin , and actually kinda cheap looking . but then it 's only a curtain liner . 
i think you have to contact the seller directly for that request . 
the colors are baby blue , light brown , cream and beige on a clear shower curtain . 
i returned it . it did n't fit my 46 3 4 '' space . 
about 5 7 8 inches wide & 4 inches long . 
no it is n't a double tension rod . it connects together-just snap together to make 1 long shower rod . 
it 's machine washable with special instructions tons on blanket or you can wash by hand 
62 '' x 50 '' 
i just measured my mother 's which i bought her about 2 months ago . it measured at 48 '' by about 59 '' 
47 x 60 inches 
oddly this is not mentioned in the manual at all . call biddeford at 800-789-6441 and ask them . after all , virtually all electric blankets are under some bed spread or comforter , so i do n't see why not . best to ask them . 
hello . thanks for your interest in our items . the taps are made of plastic and silicone to ensure your fountain is food safe . the taps can be swichted and replaced and are available in a gold-plated version as well . we hope this helps ! 
thanks for getting in touch - yes , we would ! 
it 's made out of glass . 
hello joe , thanks for getting in touch ! the average delivery time is 3-5 business days . 
no 
height 13 '' width 17 1 2 '' depth 14 1 2 '' 
abo 13 inches high , 17 inches wide and about 15 inches deep 
no , its not intended to be , and i do n't see any way to set it up . at the top tier of the unit , the sides do not even reach as high as a soup can , so if you tried attaching another rack to the top , you would lose the space of that top shelf . 
14.5 x 17.5 x 13 inches 
my guess would be ' no ' - it 's a fitted mattress cover so it might not lay neatly on top of a cot unless your cot is a standard bed size or you want to cut off the fitted sides . 
couple of inches it fits standard king sheets still 
yes 
typically a twin xl is 5 inches longer than a twin . i think you 'd find yourself fighting an uphill battle . a full size has the length but the width almost 15inches wider . there are several similar products that had an xl available in the same price range , luckily . 
it is the type of filling within the pockets the mattress topper has . honestly , i do n't think it feels what you would think something `` gel-filled '' would feel like . if i had to compare it to anything , it would be a down comforter insert ( the ones for duvets ) except a little more plush . hope that helps . 
it 's very dense however in terms of firmness it 's probable medium firm . 
i bought at the same time the best price mattress new innovated box spring platform , metal bed frame foundation , for 239 $ and it is now 115.99 on amazon and it works great . i hope this answers your question . 
we used this mattress with an existing bed frame from ikea and it holds it up well . no issue with the wood slatted bed frame ; however if the slats are too far apart , it might be an issue . 
i really do not know . all i can say is that i have slept better on this mattress than any other i have ever owned . 
in have been thur 3 of these beds i have given up the top layer goes bad after about 4 to 6 mos and i am the only one that sleeps on it do n't buy 
yup ! i have mine inside our ~900 sq ft condo in the dining room that joins with the living room . it has a few speed settings and i typically have it on the lowest for the ac setting , and i can easily hear our tv ( which is roughly 20-30 feet away ) . plus the remote digital display is portable so you can bring to the couch with you and turn it off or turn down the speed via the remote if too loud . it 's not a super quiet ac unit but it definitely is not annoyingly loud , either . 
no , just a regular plug . very convenient for placing anywhere you want it . 
no drain problem at all ! we own two of them ! one for each of my boy 's rooms and because of the dual air flow there is no need for the drain ! ( we use it exclusively for an air conditioner only , but it has other features ) 
i had to cut the window insert down to 18 '' to fit my vertical window . i just measured , and i think 16 '' will work . the distance between the 2 holes for the air hoses is 12.5 '' so at 16 '' you will have nearly 2 '' on either side of the openings for support . the height is 6 3 4 '' . 
there is a control panel , but the functions are more limited than when you use the remote . the remote is the best way to control it . 
i do n't see that mine says it has a swing function . the louvers do n't move , but the unit swivels easily on it 's rollers . since i have n't set mine up yet ( i 'm in the boston area ) , i had to go to the manual and the unit itself to see if swing function was mentioned . 
yes it would , but save yourself some money and buy a bulk roll of inexpensive , lower grade ( like grade 10 ) cheesecloth . it will still let your lawn breathe , let the sun in , and keep the birds away , but at a substantially lower price . dale - brighenti culinary support 
i have n't used my yet so i still have the info sheet which shows a u. s. flag and made in usa . there is a website also . www.brighenti-culinary.com 
hi ashley , all cotton these days is gmo , unless you buy from small organic farmers , and there just are n't enough of those to fulfill the needs of the textile industry . we certainly wish the cotton was non-gmo , but sadly , that 's the world we live in today . 
the cheesecloth worked perfectly for juicing blackberries . no squeezing required , the juice just ran right through . but making jelly is different from keeping babies safe and clean . i wish i could give you an answer . 
our cheesecloth is 36 inches wide by 180 inches long - 5 sq . yrds . - one continuous piece . 
hello stephen , we have customers who use our cheesecloth for filtering coffee , but it does take at least 2 layers to do an adequate job . the more layers , the finer the filter . 
4.5 '' wide ... 4.75 '' high ... 5.38 '' deep 
i got the chrome one 
yes 
dear raul , we are glad to hear from you . first thing this machine we making for house hold use . if you want to use this machine for a industrial purpose `` yes '' . only thing you have to give enough brake time ( 10-20 minutes ) after every 10 coconut grate.you feel little bit hot on the coconut shredder body part , that is ok. and you need couple of extra blades also , that we are selling through amazon . if you have more question feel free to ask . thanks gitachi engineering inc 
there 's no need to wash it with soap and water . a brush is provided to the purchase of the product . you use this to brush off the grated coconut residue that will be in between the teeth or what you call the grater.then , wipe off the entire part of the grater , not the motor part , with a damp paper towel . follow up by drying it off with another dry paper towel . that 's it ! ! ! 
we are in the process of designing of your requested product . will be available soon in the market . 
we already mounted it on a wooden platform with 4 rubber bush under it . so no need to do the permanent mounting and this is portable type 18 lbs electric coconut shredding machine . 
this blade is made with steel

it is removable for cleaning . and the entire cleaning process was quite easy . 
it is both a fryer and steamer . depending on what you are frying , ( chicken , turkey ) you can also use the rotisserie feature . 
yes , you should use the rotisserie every time . the turkey is not all the way submerged in oil and has to rotate to cook the turkey in the oil . 
yes ... just a bit . but try to keep the cover on . 
there is only the rotisserie rack and a basket for deep frying 
i have not used it yet . still sitting in a box . i bought the product because the propane fryers are too dangerous . 
110 v. no special outlet needed . 
yes 
box weight says 63 and product weight is 52. just correcting my answer . : ) 
contact the seller . i believe it is by design . in my case it was loud enough to disturb my sleep . 
the unit by design , evaporates the condensation it removes from the space being cooled . it does this in the same way a window ac does . 
i found the manual at this link which probably answers everybody 's questions about the product . http : cache.air-n-water.com manuals avalon-bay-ab8k.pdf 
no . the opening in narrower than a tea light . 
yes 
they are small ... .about 1 1 2 `` x 1 1 2 `` . good size for homemade lip gloss ... . 
the lids should be turn 2 times . sometimes customers thought the jar closed after one time turn and after a while when the lids open what 's inside spilled . the best way to loose the lids are open and close the lids a few times until it does n't turn anymore ( jars has a stopper to stop lids to turn more ) . to use silicon pot holders or gloves to grab and turn the lid helps it . 
what size candle ? i personally would n't use it for candles . 
i think so -- they are glass with metal lids . 
it 's 44.360ml per 1.5 us fl oz . 
@ 20 '' 
that is correct , this seat adjusts 22-31 inches off the ground . 
the surface material is bonded leather . 
they need to go in the rack business-end up , and even then they might fall through , depending on the rack design . other then that , no problem . does n't effect the finish at all . 
i would compare the size of your bottles to an opi bottle . the opi bottles are probably the widest it can fit . hope that helps 
i do n't think this bag would be big enough for 2 lunches - unless it was a light lunch or just snacks . i guess it depends on what you 'd want to pack . i believe they make a larger size that would work better . ( i also agree with the suggestion to get the one with the zipper . that 's what we have . ) 
it depends ... i use it to put my expressed milk in which is usually 2 tommee tippee bottles ( very fat bottles ) and 2 medela bottles ( more normal sized bottles ) . i could not put more than 2 tommee tippee bottles in this one where as the other lunch style bag i have i can store 4 tommee tippee bottles . the bag is plenty tall , it 's the width that is the only thing that would limit you . hope this helps ! 
seven cans fit into the bag after it is frozen and the bag will still zip closed . 
hello , and thank you for your inquiry . i apologize that the inside dimensions are not listed . if i get any more lunch bags to sell , i will make sure i will measure both inside and the outside of the lunch box . i did a little searching , and though i could n't find the dimensions of the inside of the bag , i was able to find the dimensions of the bag folded and standing tall which are 10 '' h x 8 '' w x 5 '' d ( 2 '' h x 8 '' w x 5 '' d folded ) . thank you for visiting my store , and have a nice day . 
i can fit a 16.9 oz drink bottle & rectangular containers with room for more . it is roomy and can fit a good amount of food 
the trim is gray and the lettering `` kitchenaid '' is white . hope this helps . 
yes , it works very well . got it for my daughter and me . 
good evening is compatible with the model : 5ksm7591 
yes . my sister is thrilled with her cover . 
yes . my mixer is an artisan and it fits well 
no 
17 '' wide , 12 '' tall , 7 '' deep 
no . will hold standard 0.75 liter bottles and maybe a little bigger . 
it will hold a standard 750ml bottle of wine . anything with a large round bottom like a champagne bottle or larger 1.5l bottles will not fit in this . pinot and chardonnay will be fine as long as they 're normal bottles . 
no it might prove dangerous to your lovely bottles of wine .

width : 17 '' , depth : 6.7 '' , height : 11.6 '' 
width : 17 '' , depth : 6.7 '' , height : 11.6 '' 
no . 
i can fit 32 bottles on mine . i have some sephora by opi but mainly china glaze and opi . 
bout 4in in between each shelf 
it is just 1 
you 'd have to use quite a bit ... .and it would depend on what you are actually storing ... .i use this as an organizer for my makeup compacts , so like palettes , foundation , blushes . i ended up using 2 screws . it 's extremely sturdy and carries a bit of weight . if you 're worried about holes ... .i would still use screws and just spackle : x 
you have to place them sideways , but the lip is high enough to hold them , and the little shelf deep enough to let you put one or two depending on how thick the compact is . 
no , they do not come with . there are spots in the back where you can place them , but they are not included . 
5 amps per frigidaire and 550 watts if power factor is 1.0 and voltage is 110 volts . rule of thumb ( ? ) is peak start-up current for fan and compressor will be 10 to 13 amps . should work well with 15 or 20 amp circuit breakers , provided you know the amps of other appliances in same circuit . 
if you are facing the unit , the power cord comes out from under the ac on your left . 
11.2 
noise intensity is about as loud as fan at high . noise the ac generates is not an issue for me . cools well enough for a small to mid room . 
yes ... have never checked to see if it 's adjustable ... 
there are like a light mauve , a really nice color , and an off white . however , the sides come up short , so i have added a bed skirt . the set is really very pretty . 
yes exactly these tow comes with th bedspread 
it comes with the tow pillow cases showing on the picture 
the label indicates `` made in japan '' 
with lid - 11 1 2 inches ; w o lid - 9 3 4 inches 
let 's put it this way : i have washed it in the dishwasher , no problems yet . 
yes , the label indicates `` boiling water - 212f 100c o.k . '' 
yes . but test on inconspicuous spot first to check for color fastness & the like . 
hi , lillian . i have never used the bissell spot cleaner professional portable but i can tell you about a couple of extra features that are on the rug doctor . the rug doctor portable spot cleaner has a telescoping handle as well as the carry handle . it has wheels so you can roll the cleaner to its location . i do n't know about the bissell cleaner , but the rug doctor model also allows you to reach your hand into the dirty water tank to wipe the inside . even with antimicrobial surfaces , all of the cleaners eventually grow bacteria inside of the tank . this feature is excellent . on the downside , the rug doctor portable cleaning solution is not as available in the stores as the bissell solution . however , you can use any of the rug doctor solutions in the portable cleaner . i just use about 1 oz . of cleaner per tank . i hope this info helps you make a decision . so far , i have been happy with my rug doctor . i hope this answer helps you make a more informed decision . good luck ! 
they recommend hot water , however , i have left it in before and it still cleans very well . the water would be cold of course but it is a spot cleaner so there is no way you can use up the tank every time and to me it was a huge waste of money to dump it . good for them though because it would mean selling a ton of cleaning solution . 
15 feet . between the cord and the hose , it gets to the top of my steps . 
it is roughly 5 foot long . 
yes , it does 
yes it appears to be about a 12oz bottle 
i found the rug doctor to have better suction and a better rotating brush . 
spice bottles up to 3.5 oz . sizes up to 4.5 inches tall and 2 inches wide . 
aprox . size is 19 5 8 '' tall , 15 1 4 '' long and 2 1 8 '' deep 
hello , mounts easily to your cabinet or wall 
china 
yes , it will display a negative result if something is removed from the scale after taring . because the sensors keep reading the weight of the items on the platform . please keep in mind to make sure the screen show '0 ' before you weigh an item , if it does n't show '0 ' , you may touch the tare key to clear the result and reset it to zero . 
60 seconds 
to avoid that , i would place a bowl on the scale , zero it out , and then add the amount of flour you need . that being said , the face is completely flat , so there are no crevices for it to get stuck in . 
good afternoon heather , the gowise usa gw22604 kitchen electric induction glass smooth top cooktop has increments of 30 degrees fahrenheit . if you have any other questions or concerns , please feel free to contact us , thank you ! -gowise usa 
this cooktop works with 18 0 stainless steel and iron and must have a base that is at least 4.7 '' wide and flat only . 
first i must say i love my keurig k45 . the color is beautiful and it makes delicious coffee . the largest cup it makes is 10 ounces . however , with the removable tray you could easily and quickly make another cup of coffee to fill a larger cup if you wanted . 
call keurig . in fact , you should always contact the manufacturer first even if the warranty has expired . sometimes they 'll bend the rules or at least protate the cost of a new one . 
yes - you have to purchase a separate little filter and take out the k-cup holder in the keurig itself , but you can use your own grounds . the 2.0 versions of keurig which are the newest models on the market will not allow this . so if you want to brew your own , then you will have to purchase a model number that precedes the 2.0 - which is why i bought this one 
when you make the last cup of coffee shut it off , and drain out whatever water there 's in the container , by not letting the water boil for the next cup it will not be in the tubes , if further questions you 're free to write me , good luck 
i think it 's probably the size of the water tank 
no 
anna , i 'm not trying to be a smart ass but you should read the manual ... it does make hot chocolate and be sure to run it once without any product after you are done to clean the machine ... ..all in the manual ... 
yes 
yes ! you can do just about anything with this food processor . when it arrives , there is a small booklet with a reference to a new york company . call the 800 number in order to purchase , a mixer attachment , wide slicing and grating blade and a couple more items . they are very inexpensive ( between 10 and 12 dollars ) . i ordered everything available . i love this food processor- the ny support people are exceptional also . 
of course it is . although i had to return mine because of power failure , this machine is fabulous . 
i believe so , i donated the one i bought to an alzhiemers facility . 
yes , you can pulse , as i recall ... .. 
yes , absolutely ! i believe that is what it gets used for the majority of the time ! 
if you are asking how wide the grommet hole is the answer is 3 8 '' . the hole that the grommet is inserted into is 5 8 '' . 
yes it does . it also comes with a little rubber cork to put in when you are done fermenting and want to store in the fridge . 
yes , it comes with the hole . it has a little rubber gasket already installed so that the airlock fits in very securely . 
yes , no problem

i have a two room condominium , with full kitchen and bath , 750 sq feet , as well as an open porch , in atlanta , where it is generally very hot all summer . the dyson is just fabulous . i have two . it will clear the air a good 20-30 feet . i really like the rotation of it . it helps me save on my air-conditioning costs . the heat function also is perfect for our mild winters here . i very much recommend the dyson . 
the front of the opening in 12 '' and the back is 10 '' . it is the new quiet dyson . so far so good . i recommend it . ajo 
yes . wind volume is not very strong and i dont think it is quiet . 
it is very quiet , almost like a breeze thru the window or white noise .

no it 's desk mounted 
19 3 4 inches from table top to peak 
of course it does , it 's a fan ... 
greetings . each link is closed but there is no solder , or anything other than stainless steel for that matter . and yes , this scrubber can be used on cast iron . thanks for checking in . knapp made products 
for all of our products we try to keep the work in the us . but the only place chain mesh of this quality ( 316 grade stainless steel ) is available is china , so that 's where we get it . polishing , finishing , assembly and packaging are all done in the usa . 
i bought for a cast iron skillet and works great . 
the chainmail dishcloth is made from the finest restaurant food grade stainless steel . it will never rust . knapp made products 
yes , just wash off with warm water 
i do n't see why you would n't be able to . i was actually going to do the same for my daughter 's b'day , however , i found one to rent and the sugar mix for 25 dollars at a local party supplier . plus the kids enjoyed making their own so it worked out . if you do use the premade , i am assuming the stick would slide in easily . 
there are 10 sticks , each stick has 8 different functions for the lights . 
yes , each individual cone lights up . they have several settings as well -- you can have the lights on steady or there are different settings speeds for the lights to blink . 
that would depend on your location 
sorry , i do n't know i just use them for few minutes 
just the holder ... 
the item was shipped in a box . it was packaged in a drawstring bag inside the box . 
i did not try this ! but it appears that you could cut it down to needed size ! it is like a big sponge ! 
the density of this memory foam is 3 lbs . 
it fully expands to the dimensions in sellers description . have had for about 12 weeks and satisfied . 
2 '' of memory pad . the white under it shows you how it sits on a mattress . 
there is only one layer 2 inches thick . 
look deeper into the product description .

hey lisa , after my a few tried with beets , it works for us . we have some experience you might like to know regard to how to use our envy slicer for best results : - regarding getting a better experience with carrots , zucchini , beets ... i remember that the first time we used carrots ourselves , the strips did n't come out from the blade as long strips . because carrots are hard , often their strips wo n't be as long as with soft vegetables such as summer squash , zucchini , eggplant , beets , etc . i practiced with zucchini ( as you can see on the package ) and were quickly able to get nice , long strips with our carrots . be sure to use fresh carrots , zucchini that are thick enough to fully utilize your slicer blades . - strongly recommend using fresh and thick veggies enough for best results . if it does n't work , it might be due to very rarely item which defective during shipping processing . although this product is very easy to use which is designed for `` no-brainer '' to use , it might need a little practice depend on various people 's desire . hope this help ! -jessica 
no this pitcher is not glass . this is the description on the website : 2 quart capacity ( 8 glasses ) make , serve and store all in one . airtight , twist lid locks in freshness and flavor stain , cloud and odor proof . durable , high temperature material with glass-like clarity leak-proof , can store on its side . interchangeable accessories available ( sold separately ) dishwasher safe , bpa free , made in usa 
it 's safe for hot water . i pour fresh brewed tea in it regularly ! 
no it does not . i have seen that model at peets coffee here in california but do not know if it is on amazon . 
3 '' 
the lid does not have a strainer , but you can control how much pours out by how much you unscrew the lid . 
standard 
yes two plain white zipped covers . 
4 inches . they 're 21x15x4 . they say `` twin '' or standard , but they 're actually not the same as a regular twin pillow . i 've found that the jumbo size is between a regular twin standard and a queen sized pillow you 'd buy at a bedding store . the jumbo fits in a king pillow case with about 10 inches to spare at the end , but it 's not baggy in width . i ca n't speak to the twin fit in a standard pillow case , but it will fit , the case will be oversized on it , though . 
17 x 25 inches , measuring seam to seam on the coverlet . 
the home shopping network ( hsn ) website offers the pillowcases as a separate item in various colors . 
the density is approximately 4.5 lbs 
no . even compressed it would be far too bulky to fit in a suitcase . 
i do n't know the exact measurements , i 'm sorry . but i have a queen size mattress and it fits perfectly on top of it . 
i 've only used it on top of another mattress , but it was dense enough that you hardly moved once you were asleep . very comfortable . have to let it air out a bit as it had a noticeable smell , but that eventually goes away : - ) 
on solid piece of memory foam 4 '' thick . it is vacuum packed so has to be allowed to expand over 24 hours . 
not sure if it 's in fact 'gel ' , but it is very comfortable as long as it 's on a semi firm surface or the other mattress is not to mushy . 
yes , but no peculiar smell 
1103 grams ( 38.9 ounces ) 
this product is made in china and is of high quality . 
i do n't know , but i personally i do not put mine in the dishwasher . i think it looks better to hand wash . 
the top is stainless steel , but the seal is rubber . 
even if only half of the boiling water , its warm-keeping effect as well . we did the test , after 4 hour the temperature to 91 c after 8 hour the temperature to 78 c after 12 hour the temperature to 65 c of course , there may be differences in actual use . 
not only made in china , but also design created in china , as i read the user manual written in english . 
yes . it worked fine with timer . you can preset the cooking end time that means program will start much earlier than end ( ready ) time . 
dear valued customer , thank you for contacting rosewill support service . you should be able to cook lentils and legumes with the rice cooker . however , you will need to search for recipe online as rhrc-13001 is mainly for rice cooking , porridge , stewing small pot rice , reheating , soup , steaming , and soaked rice , according to different rice species . thank you for choosing rosewill . sincerely , mick rosewill support service agent call center hours : 1-800-575-9885 8am - 5pm ( pst ) monday - friday 
yes , both are included + a plastic steaming container . 
i 'm not sure exactly what the material is composed of , but it 's a regular teflon-type non-stick coating . i would contact rosewill directly for specifics . 
should be using the pot it comes with . 
the lid has 3 pieces that are removable without tools . it is very easy to clean . 
no need to , it 's redundant unless you do n't have a wooden plank or bed frame with wire support for the mattress . 
i think it would its flexable 
the box is approx . 4ft tall and 2ft wide 
if you are just using it as a bed i do n't see why not , if it 's folding into a couch , maybe not , matress may be too thick , i think they make memory foam mattresses just for futons though . 
i did , but it 's difficult to get back on . 
yes but you do need something like a platform bed to put it on . it wo n't sit in like the regular metal frame by itself that you use with a matress and a box spring . 
yes . there is a right side up due to the layering . 
dust mites are n't harmful to people but can cause allergies . the barrier blocks skin particles from getting into the mattress , cutting off the mites ' food supply so they decrease in number . you may be thinking of bedbugs , which do bite and for which you would need a fully encasing protector . 
i find it to be slightly warmer than without it , but less than some other mattress protectors . it 's really not too bad and it 's very comfortable . 
no , it is not thick . just plush . if it helps . i was looking for something without padding it all , because i have 12 '' mattress with padding on top . i was looking for something i can wash periodically , sits well on a mattress without moving around , and works nicely in hot climates ( i live on maui , hi ) . all of these qualities i found in this cover . so , no padding . i hope it helps . 
it hums like any air conditioner but is n't overly loud . i can hardly hear it when in the next room 
25.4 '' is listed as the width . 
these ffr models are designed to be used through a window however frigidaire does make through-wall models ( fft models ) which can be ordered with an optional wall sleeve . 
eer 
yes . it has a slide out chassis . 
i would n't attempt to to anything that is not the consistency of cooked potatoes . i suggest a meat grinder for meat and poultry . 
my kids and i love this potato ricer . yes , the disk plate was locked by the collar and it did n't moved . i made a very sticky and the stuff came out just fine . i have owned this tools for about nine months and i do n't feel any regret at all . if u do n't have one , you should get one for yourself . 
yes 
i prefer the larger holed mesh . 
the best i can tell they are identical 
i have n't tried it myself , but i do n't see why not . it has to plates with different size holes and you control the pressure . 
yes ! we have a pillow top , and it fits perfectly . 
yes 
hello . i wash it in warm water and dry it at a low temperature setting , or air dry . 
it says 100 % polyester knit . 
the fabric is n't very see through . it is a stretchy polyester fabric that mostly covers the pattern on our mattress . 
sort of a plastic material 
any depth 
no handles 
these are giant plastic bags , without the locking seal . i suppose if you got creative you could roll it and , with help , tape it up while still keeping the air out , but there is nothing to seal on the bag . 
i think it 's durable enough to protect the mattress well . just be careful when carrying as it may tear the cover . 
we make all of our bags with a 2.2 mil non vented ( which means no holes so it 's water , dust and debris proof ) recycled plastic with bio degradable and anti mold additives . to date , we are the thickest plastic mattress cover made in america and since we use a non slip process ( this is a very cool application ) , it allows the bag to easily slide on and pull tight without ripping . it 's non crinkling or crackling , so it 's ideal to seal and then dress the bed without effecting the feel when your sleeping . if you have any other questions , just let us know and we 're here to help you ! ! thanks ! spence 
i have n't tried it in there but i do n't know why you could n't . it does work well in a regular oven though . i have n't tried it on broil because i would n't think you 'd need it . a toaster over is an oven so i do n't see why not . i just did n't want to cut mine because i use it with a larger pan . 
no . this is to use in the oven inside a baking sheet . it stops your food from sitting in grease while it cook . it 's hard to clean after . 
there is only one and fit approx std cookie sheet 
the raised portions are about half of an inch high . 
yes , my daughter gave me one and it works well in the microwave , just be sure to put a paper towel over the bacon to cut down on splatter . don 
i 've only used it in metal sheet pans , but see no reason why it would n't work in an oven-proof glass container of any kind , up to the 428f suggested limit . however , i stopped using it after just a few times due to being unable to clean it properly and having food and grease stick into the crevices even after hand washing and repeated dishwasher cleaning . i would not recommend it based on my own poor experiences with the product . 
i do n't have the packaging any more so i ca n't say for certain if it said bpa free , but the way i understand it bpa is a plastic based issue and these mats are food grade silicone , not plastic . 
i have not had any trouble so far . 
it looks like real leather 
yes it is - we have used it for exactly that . i would not recommend to have a 300 lb . person sit on it , but it certainly works fine for a `` normal '' size adult . 
not sure , very high quality and very pleased with them . 
it does not do a very good job of grinding large , hard spices such as nutmeg . you would need to break up the nut somewhat to get a fine grind of nutmeg . nothing works as well as a microplane for nutmeg . 
yes i use it for flaxseeds and chia seeds . 
you must apply pressure downwards from the top of the unit for the grinder to work . 
we tried it and it does grind almond . we like this machine , it is durable and easy to use . nahla 
not that i have found . the longer you grind the finer the coffee . i pulse my grinder to get the grind i prefer . i have made castor sugar in the grinder ( it is almost as fine as powdered sugar ) and it worked great . i really do love it , it works great on everything i have tried . 
it depends on how fine you want to grind it . the dual blade coarse grinds and i mostly use it for coffee and nuts . i use the four blades for spices when i want something finely ground . i hope this helps . 
it 's the best grinder i have ever owned . i never used it for rice but have ground allspice which is quite hard . one key thing to note is that you need to pulse with it instead of steady grind . 
200 
we have a 10 '' thick mattress and they fit perfectly , i would n't use them for anything bigger . 
i never even bothered to look it up . probably not the usa . this is a repurchase because they are so great ! the other set lasted two years . 
these bamboo sheets are 300 tc . however , bamboo fabric are naturally soft , and making these with higher thread count than 300tc will cause the sheets to pill . 
i bought these , do n't bother , they are terrible and most bamboo sheets , towels are great but these were not . they looked great out of the package but once they were washed and dried , they were awful . 
it can be used to fold towels ... but i would look elsewhere . very flimsy construction which does not hold up with regular use 
it sure does ! it will work on anything . if you 're using adult clothes and the bottom of the shirt is longer than the folder , just fold that up until it 's even . but , with kids clothes , you 'll never have that problem . this is a great way to fold when you 're limited on space . since everything folds to the same size , you can store more in less space . good luck ! : ) 
it 's good ! i 've been using mine for a couple of months now . it 's showing no signs of falling apart . 
no just depth 
the folded dimensions is 22cmx28.5cm , thanks . 
yes ! i fold xxl shirts on it all the time ! it can fold any size shirt ! 
that would depend on the size . all of these are based on standard bed sizes and leave an inch on all sides to ensure your sheets fit over the mattress and topper . the approximate sizes are : twin 37 '' x 73 '' twin xl 37 '' x 78 '' full 52 '' x 73 '' full xl 52 '' x 78 '' queen 58 '' x 78 '' king 74 '' x 78 '' cal king 70 '' x 82 '' 
this mattress topper is a semi-dense foam 
a simple answer would be . . . adequately . they definitely are not as `` insulated '' as a fully insulated cup , however , they do insulate better than your basic plastic or china cup . i sure hope this vague response helps . 
yes 
china is the country where this cup was manufactured . 
no , except a few texts to look like the real lens . 
yes it does . its wrapped with oversized bubble wrap to keep it from moving around in the box . 
yes 
yes , it is dishwasher safe 
nope -- it 's lined with stainless steel . 
it can be reused . 
it stands 49 1 2 inches high . 
no . the `` brackets '' should be on the bed frame , but it does come with bolts , nuts and washers . 
it is very good and strong it 's real wood so i think so it is strong . 
if they have bolts 
these are glass . thanks for looking 
they are glass 
not without making a mess ( at least in my experience ) . but there is a get-around to this problem . put your liquids in a regular freezer bag container and freeze it . then take the frozen liquid out of the regular freezer container and you can vacuum seal the frozen solid liquids with no problem ( and no mess ) . 
the one i purchased was only for 110 volt , you will need to contact manufacture to see if they have one that runs on 220v . 
it does not , but you can still use them and cut them to size without having the roll `` stored '' in the machine . 
yes , i called ! ! ! place 2 of the flat lids on till sealed then remove the top one and you will have a tight seal . i wanted it for that reason , and was down to the last ok to buy it she i saw your question and the answers you were getting . i stopped right there , and called . i have bought mine . 
since the peaches are frozen there should be no moisture so it is not necessary to use the moist setting , however you are not hurting anything by using that setting . 
11-7 16 is the size that came with my foodsaver and it is so tight that you can hardly get it in the slot for it . if you can buy 11-1 4 bags they would be easier to deal with . 
amazon sells them http : www.amazon.com foodsaver-t03-0024-02-3-pack-bottle-stoppers dp b0000cfph9 and the food saver bags come in 11 '' wide rolls on amazon too ... ... http : www.amazon.com foodsaver-fsfsbf0616-000-11-roll dp b00005otxu 
i find softer things like breads often get squashed , unless you hit the seal button as soon as it 's drawn just enough vacuum . it is n't as hard a vacuum , so it does n't preserve as long . 
i do n't think so . they 're very thin and lightweight . either tin or aluminum . 
they are very well made with a silicon rubber seal on the push on lids . while not super expensive , they also were not as large as i was thinking they 'd be as the add says 16 ounce canister . so i thought that meant they would each hold 16 ounces of product , in my case loose tea as i 'd bought several bags of the davidson bulk teas of various varieties . they only hold a few ounces per can but they are air tight and are easily refillable . look nice too ! 
about 2 1 2 inches in dm 
negative , these tins have 1 metal lid with a plastic lining that inserts into the top of the tin . they stay on decently well because of this plastic seal . 
pop on 
i doubt it . 
yes , this brush will fit nicely into a 1.25 '' diameter opening . i use the brush primarily for a small container with a 1 '' diameter opening . this is a quality product and works fantastic for me . 
i believe it can . i use mine for large , hard plastic bottles . 
it looks high when you first get it . but , after sleeping on it a few times it goes down . had mine for a couple months now , and it settled to mid way between high and low . 
yes . you can unzip and wash . 
two infants maybe . i think it 's really meant for one child . 
yes . mine has a zipper . this is a fav at our house . 
yes of course 
fairly light ... .im not sure only a few lbs . 
it 's very sturdy and solid -- i 'd say it should n't have problems with 250 lbs . 
no 
there is no filter . it is an atomizer which sprays fine vapor mist upward into the air which evaporates quickly . actually has no actual user-accessible moving parts . ideal for a room or small apartment , not for a home ( 1,250 square feet or more ) . 
i dont think so when the power button is on ... it 's a nice blue light ... good luck 
no , it means there are 3 jars in the package , and there is just one package -- 3 jars total . 
not unless the holder is large . they do not fit in mine ... in a toyota sienna . 
they are made of thick plastic ! 
yes 
the glass is tempered and of good quality . 
leather is black wood is dark brown . i got this set about 5 months ago . it is ok , the glass looks good . the chairs are cheaply made . 
no , it is not solid wood . it does n't quite look like compressed board but it likely is some type of manufactured wood and painted the dark brown cherry wood color . still looks fabulous , and feels sturdy . we 've gotten lots of compliments on our set and we love it . 
it 's more like dark browne . 
the base of the table is not available for separate purchase . 
to heat up water in ? you could but i do n't think it 'd work well , it 's double walled so no heat will be directly applied to it 's content . 
this press is all metal construction . no plastic components . 
you should not ever need to replace the screen . french presses , such as this one , are made with a permenant screen . 
inside dimensions are 3 5 8 . *note-to be sure that coffee stays hot , i make a plug out of aluminum foil . 
since you use the press to make the coffee , you pour the coffee off after it has brewed for about four minutes . if you leave it in longer the resulting coffee is very strong . so , the press is n't really intended to store hot coffee . 
after allowing for coffee , it holds about 4 cups . 
all stainless-steel ( pot , plunger , screen , wire tensioner ) . no plastic bits . 
a california king mattress will be 72 '' wide x 84 '' long 
my wife tells me that regular fitted sheets are what she uses and they fit just fine . also , note : i phoned the manufacturer in arizona with some questions befoe my purchase . they were more than happy to answer any and all questions and spent about 30 minutes doiong so . i would suggest you do the same . i obtained their name from amazon 's site . larry 
i personally spoke with the manufacturer in arizona about what is needed for support for their memory foam mattress . nothing special is needed ! he suggested to me that i purchase any box spring that is well made , in other words wo n't squeak , and that would be adequate . in fact , if one wanted to , the mattress could be placed on a well constructed wood platform , or even on the floor itself . of course , the floor would make it difficult to get on and off the mattress but the support would be just fine . i purchased an inexpensive , queen size , arkansas mfg . box spring . it cost about $ 100.00 . it is giving all the support the mattress needs . if the box spring lasts only five years , wo n't bother me . . . .i 'll just purchase another for $ 100 or so . larry 
we bought the `` saferest premium hypoallergenic waterproof mattress protector - vinyl , pvc and phthalate free '' here on amazon . it is very nice , good quality and a great barrier . 
i received 3-hard floor cleaners 1-hard wood floor polisher 1-carpet stain scrubber 1-carpet cleaning pad pads are suppose to be rinsed right after use before you wash them in the washer . the manual states they will need replaced after 20 uses . 
it comes with six pads total , two pads for each type of cleaning ( polishing , wood floors , and carpet . ) it also comes with a small bottle of each solution . the small bottles are concentrate and when mixed with water , it will fill the big bottle three times or so . 
i think it depends on how deeply set the grout is . it cleaned the grout in my kitchen very nicely but in a couple of the other rooms , the tile is thicker and the machine does n't seem to get down into the grout as well . if your grout is level to your tile , it will work very well . 
the best thing is you get a new pad with every refill bottle so with several pads i can change it when it gets dirty from each time i use the machine . you just throw dirty pads in washer and they are good as new . rule of thumb ... the cleaner the pad the better when washing your floors . it 's not so much how often in time but how dirty is the floor and how large the area . 
you sure can ! ! however , just a warning : if you 've got high gloss , new laminate floors like i do , it 's finicky- like , you ca n't spray too much solution , or you ca n't spray too little . if you spray too much , as you go it 'll look great , but an hour later , a film develops . i still would recc 'd this product- it has saved my back . just be mindful of how many times you press the button to release the cleaner ! i hope this helps you ! : ) 
yes , in a way . it has : low ; off ; and high . 
we have bamboo hardwood floors-does excellent job . 
china of course . 
the inside of the cup is , the lid on the inside is plastic 
no fingerprints at all . i really like mine . 
yes 
just measured with my tape measure for you and appears to be exactly 12 '' or 1 foot . : ) 
box says 17 feet . it seems like you have 15 usable feet . 
this vacuum has a plastic container that you empty after use instead of a paper bag . 
yes 
yes it does . 
i 'm not sure on the exact weight it 's definitely light ! ! ! 
yes 
no 
99 min . and 60 sec . i love the little thing . 
only about 15 seconds , then stays silent . if you miss the alarm you 're out of luck ! 
yes . if you buy that many we can eliminate the shipping charge 
about 1 2 inch wider than a credit card at the rounded top and about the same length 
yes , it has a little metal piece that you can use as a stand 
yes , it can ! it can count down even 1 second . 
aaa 
yes ! ! ! ! it is very powerful in the high years and very gentle in the low gears . it 's perfect . 
on the lowest speed it starts out slowly and i have found this very helpful to minimize splattering . i really like this mixer and i use it a lot ! this is the first hand mixer i have owned that i can control splattering . 
yes , it works very well with both . 
the same switch-button that is used to select the speed is also the eject button when it is pushed . this could be an issue for some people since one might push down on the button in the process of selecting a speed . i have n't had any problem with it , however ... 
a little over 2 feet . 
8 1 2 by 3 1 2 by 5 1 2. it 's a fairly large hand mixer . seems to be heavy duty . i like mine . a little heavy but i 'm getting use to it . 
i do n't own the box anymore , but the dimensions of the actual mixer ( standing tall ) is 8 1 2 '' high x 6 1 2 '' deep , which includes the on off switch jutting out a bit . 
i have n't used it for dough yet , however i think it is powerful enough for that purpose . i do not have dough hooks with mine . 
i live in australia and mine was firmly packed and i had no issue so i think you will be safe 
it 's just one 
yes . i 've made hot chocolate in it before using the microwave . it is not dishwasher safe . my boyfriend 's mom forgot , and now it 's ruined . the color changing label melted and distorted . 
i bought these solely based on size , i was very disappointed when i received these . dimensions listed are way off for a pillow . actual dimensions are 20 '' x 12 '' and i 'm rounding up ! 
nowhere that i know of . i had to sew my own because they swim in standard cases . i bought tees at goodwill , sewed them into the right size with the neck hole on the back side to use as the pillow insert . the stretch of tees is great to get the pillows positioned as you like without hampering the way traditional case materials do . 
yes . you will receive ( 2 ) pillows but they are a bit smaller than a standard sized pillow . 
yes you will receive 2 pillows 
yes it is 100 % micro beads ! i love my pillows , they form to your neck and i have no crooks or pain in my neck and shoulders now : ) definitely worth it ! 
no , they do not . 
i do n't know . they sent me tge wrong items . ordered 2 pillows but received two pillow inserts that are supposed to keep u cool . sorry . 
just the frame and headboard piece 
yes it will 
the frame will fit a queens size matter , the frame is bigger after the matter lay on th lex frame they are about two inches space on each side of the bed , the material is very feeble , the side board is broker and it 's not even a month since i purchase the bed . but after it assemble it is sturdy , just feeble material it compose of . 
yes . i puchased the queen size and its great . 
gel foam bed . 
it is black with black leather . 
i tried it on a bag of m & ms and it sealed it but did n't vacuum seal it . it made the noise like it was trying to suck the air out but did n't . 
you can order the jar attachments separately . there is one for the wide-mouth and one for the regular-mouth jar . one other buyer figured out how to adapt the accessory attachment to operate the jar attachments . call customer service for help . 
the v4880 is a specific model number from within the v4800 series . there are multiple v4800 series models such as the v4825 , v4865 , and v4880 . all of these foodsaver operate in the same manner and the only difference is that the v4880 and v4865 each have a pulse vac feature that other v4800 series do not have . the pulse vac feature allows you to manually pulse vacuum the air out of the bags . this feature is great when vacuum packaging soft or delicate items that may crush or damage through a continuous vacuum cycle . 
yes , just use the moist cycle , and watch that it does n't get into the heat part . 
china 
no , just # 2 but it 's worth buying . walmarts are now selling them . 
yes , but what would you put in the snack cup ? maybe peanuts ? 
i have seen 4 different color schemes in the stores ... that 's the only way you would be able to choose what you get 
cheap ours broke ! 
it comes assorted , so no way of picking a color and the listing is for 1 cup only 
not unless you have 2 hours . it get 's clogged up constantly . tried on squash and it was a disaster . i am going to get something better for this . 
the peeler is manufactured in china . 
the box says `` designed in london , england . made in china . '' 
product dimensions : 15.4 x 6.6 x 13.9 inches 
it will hold diapers , of course , but to hold a day 's worth , you 'll need to buy a large size trash can . i 'd recommend purchasing a container made just for diapers and it also has odor control . 
mine is in the bathroom for over a year and no rust so far . the inside is lined in black plastic . i was worried the chrome would rust but so far the product has withstood bathroom weather so well it looks new . 
you can push the lid all the way back and it will stay open . 
this can is about 13 inches height , 11.5 inches depth and 6 inches width . 
6.6 inches wide ... 15.4 inches long deep ... 13.9 inches tall when lid is closed ... 25.4 when the lid is opened 
it should with a little extra space since most dakimakura covers are for 150cm or more and this pillow is 137cm in length 
the box is slightly larger than the pillow . it does not smoosh or crush the pillow at all . you could fit a small human being in it , but probably should n't . 
no 
hello patty , the pillow does not come with a cover . 
yes it is . i always dry it off well and is does great 
it has n't heated up easily as far as i can tell . i do n't use it for things that would require more than a couple of minutes of blending , and most things not more than about 30 seconds of blending . i am well satisfied with it . 
it looks like the part on the attachment is metal but the part it fits into is a hard white probably plastic . it has a lot of power and so far i have been really satifsied . 
probably not . it is not the intended use . the blender is for soft fruits and veggies . 
yes 
absolutely . i chopped a few cups of pecans in it for my cooking class . it is very powerful . i wish i had bought this one for myself instead of the cuisinart . 
the blades are metal and the motor , etc are encased in plastic , but they feel heavy and sturdy . 
yes , as long as the mouth of the jar is not a wide mouth . 
pint size jars 
the mounting bracket is attached to the back and on page 8 of the installation instructions , placement of the mounting plate , item # 4 -- it states that the 'mounting plate is attached to the back of the oven ' . i know that this question was asked over a year ago , but when i was preparing to buy this oven , i too was asking the same question and it was n't until we opened the box to prepare for installation of the oven , that i came across the answer to this question . so , i hope that this will be helpful to anyone looking for this answer while contemplating whether to buy it or not . 
not at all ! 
length 30 '' height 15.5 '' depth 15.5 '' 
yes , first button on the top row . 
not really . just remember to reduce cooking time by about 20 % for regular oven times . great to have the option to use as mw or convection oven - or both ! 
yes . we do from time to time . 
if used as a convection oven , alone or in combo with the microwave function , it will do things just as any hot air oven will . so , though i have n't tried it yet , i am sure that it will brown chicken when using the convection oven . i find it takes a long time to pre-heat - so unless i need a second oven , i do n't use it on convection . 
we have been using ours daily for a little over a year . no discolouration seen inside . 
this is a case where pictures help a lot . http : bit.ly 1iv441c http : bit.ly 1lnxwri there are screws that go into the desktop from underneath that include longer ones from the left-right braces and shorter ones from the arms on the left and right . the instructions clearly tell you to do this all upside-down , with the desktop on the ground face down . i did n't do that , because i did n't have room for it , and it was very , very difficult , but it would have been very easy if i followed directions . 
hello . the black frames are enroute to amazon and we expect them to become available within the next 5 business days . 
most materials wo n't require pre drilled holes , and you can mount the desk frame and handset controls anywhere you 'd like . if you 'd like some suggestions we 're here to help . 
just one . it 's super easy to put together ! the only thing you have to do is attach the legs and viola ! finished . 
175 lbs 
53 inches 
36 inches 
it 's about 10 '' tall . it 's very lightweight and though it says it holds 64 fluid ounces , i 'm not certain it actually does . overall it seems quite small to me . i apologize that i have n't tried it out to make sure if it can or ca n't hold 64 ounces . i was a bit disappointed with this pitcher , though i will probably use this when i need another pitcher for when people come for any event . ... i think margaritas would look pretty in this pitcher . : ) 
i , personally , wash my pitcher by hand . however , i did go on their site and all of the glass iced tea glass pitchers indicated dishwasher safe . for the price and design , it is worth the purchase ; and they include a package of tea . the tea is so delicious -- i had a 1oz maharaja chai samurai chai tea blend . ( i drank it hot ! ) . loved it . 
i use hot water in mine 
yes it is as long as you have n't had the glass in the fridge , or have ice in it . 
after two months 
yes it does and it 's a great machine . 
i use daily when i 'm not traveling and love it ! 
i use lysol wipes . it dries quickly . 
thermopop can be used to temp items in the oven , however it can not be left in the oven . it will melt ! 
no 
i 'm not sure what the temperature of farmer 's cheese should be ( so is it in the range of what the thermo pop can measure ) ; but if the question is can it determine liquid temperatures , the answer is yes and very quickly . 
no , but it sure works well . not many are waterproof 
yes you can , just wait a few seconds for the most accurate reading ... .i have used it for the liquid portion of bread already and it is very accurate . just be sure when checking temperature , that the tip does not touch the pot or the container . because that will give you an inaccurate reading . 
the probe is 4.5 '' long . it is 1 8 '' ( 3 cm ) thick , except for the last 1 2 '' ( at the tip ) where it narrows to 2 cm ( a little over 1 16 '' ) . 
average , about 2 to 3seconds . 
i do n't think so . it 's meant to be inserted into chicken or meat to check the internal temperature . there are special thermometers for frying temperature . 
yes . 
excellent . it does run hot so check your chicken before your normal time that you are use to in your regular oven . mine works better than my oven ever did . 
the rack must be pulled forward , similar to a conventional oven . it is not attached . 
yes we have a layer of aluminum foil at the bottom of the tray . just keep it away from the heat elements . which is not a problem normally.hope that makes sense . 
no 
yes , that is what i have . i figured i was taking a chance buying the salt plate holder , but although it 's a bit cumbersome because of the thick block , it does fit . 
yes . fits well . 
it will it just will not be a tight fit but it will work . 
yes 
fits 12 x 8 x 2 perfectly . 12 x 8 x 1.5 would work as well . any smaller on length and width would have tray sticking out . 
yes it will fit in this holder . 
no . your block is too small . at your size your salt risks breaking so the holder wo n't be able to support it . 
8.5 x 12 inches , very sturdy with some cross bars in the center . 
no filter needed . that is to say , the wine aerator does not use a filter . 
it is easy to rinse with water or you can put it in the dishwasher . the main problem is that residual wine will drip from the aerator into the holding cup , so you have to clean everything after each use . 
really enhanced my merlot . 
the aerator is made of acrylic . 
hi jing , without any significant problem is not residuios that may change caracterticas varietal . best regards fabian 
china . 
injecting air ( oxygen ) into wine improves its flavour . this aerator does a good job . it can also be used for individual glasses . you can get a similar response by decanting the wine so that you have turbulent rather than laminar flow going into the decanter . slow down for the last portion of the bottle to avoid sediments flowing into the decanted wine . 
which opening are you referring to ? where you pour the wine in or where the wine comes out ? inside diameter where you pour the wine in is 2 inches ( a little less ) . other end is approx 7 16 of an inch . 
a box spring is optional ( not necessary ) . bed comes with a slat support system . thanks , modhaus 
yes 
no 
yes . the mattress sits on top of the frame and not sunk down into the frame . it 's a good looking bed that with the mattress does sit lower to the ground than our other beds . we use it as a guest bed and it adds a little challenge for our elderly parents but is fine for everyone else . 
smooth . not sure i 'd say soft ... .not rough though . 
there are 2 metal rails that spans the length and width of the bed ( dividing it in quarters ) . there are 26 wooden slats included , 13 for each half of the bed . they attach with some kind of plastic clips . i will be selling my slats and clips on ebay this week since i did not use them . 
i am not familiar with the eureka easy clean but i am not overjoyed with my dyson either . it is just not the quality i was expecting and i find it awkward to use . it does not last very long either on the battery . sorry to disappoint you - i love my other dyson products . 
works for 17 minutes then dies . bummer ! but recharges in about an hour . you can do the entire car in 17 minutes ! 
the attachments from my previous handheld ( 5 or 6 years old ) did fit my new handheld . 
only 2 , the brush and the thin one . 
it does work for pet hair but i think you 'd be better off with something more powerful , less portable , and longer lasting for a sofa . 
yes . 
no 
yes , this frame will hold a king size mattress and the box springs . what we found , was that for a king size mattress , they actually sell you 2 xl twin box springs . this frame is very nice , i was impressed with its quality . 
it says in the description . 7inches . 
sleep revolution compack bed frame king size should accommodate your king sized mattress at 76 '' x 80 '' . 
if they are the standard 38 '' wide , yes , they will fit into a king frame . http : www.beddingexperts.com mattress-sizes-chart 
not sure but i loved ... 
yes ! you can attach it to a head and foot board it has slots where it can be screwed in on all for sides 
the plates to attach the headboard is 4 1 2 inches from the floor to the bottom , and 8 1 2 inches from the floor to the top . there are 4 holes for bolts to go through for a head board . i can not measure their height without taking the bed apart . sorry . 
no 
very good 
by how much water you put in your cup . 
i do n't now 
the water capacity is one issue , the heating element is probably the other ... less wait time between cups and a hotter cup of coffee 
its a 110v 
yep , super easy . just kind of snaps into and out of place for easy filling under the faucet . 
the capsules come as milk or coffee . fir instance the cappuccino would be made from 2 capsules ie 1 milk and 1 coffee . whereas the american houseblend is just 1 coffee capsule and you may want to add milk and sugar after depending on your preference . its teally easy to make though . i would definitely recommend it . 
assembly of the grill is very easy . just set the grill plate on the grill and pull out the pins on either side of the plate and it will drop in and just release the pins . do the same for the other grill plate . 
inside grill is 11 1 2 inches long 8 inches wide . i have 5-6 nice hamburgers on it . with the lid adjustment for height i cooked sausage and chicken , thighs and legs . also great for cooking bacon when you need a lot of slices cooked . 
no , but i have only had mine for six months . it grills chicken evenly with the grill marks making it taste like it just came off of the grill . im very happy with my purchase . an easy way to clean up for me is to place wet paper towels onto the grill and close the top . making sure it was been unplugged of course . return and hour later , throw out the towels , wiping off as much yuck as possible.then i clean with a soapy sponge and rinse . so easy . never take a scrubber to the grill pieces or else you 'll damage the the surface of the grill plates . 
do n't know exact weight , but no problem handling easily , even lifting to a high shelf . 
yes 
yes both the top and bottom cooking plate is removeable . 
no it does not . only thing i do n't like is cord real short . 
i do n't think so , at least not in the ordinary sense . the bottom grill in mine has raised ridges running 'down ' to the front to drip out the grease . the upper has ridges as well , except they 're kind of a 'herringbone ' pattern . if you tried to bake a hotcake on the foreman , it would look more like a waffle if you had the top down . i guess the answer is , not unless you can buy one with a flat plate , it is a great meat cooker , but do n't know how it 'd be as a griddle . rg 
absolutely not . the us model is 110 only ! 
it does have a dough hook , but i 've never used it for that , but i would assume so 
yes , there is a food processor attachment thay does that . it 's fantastic . 
i have ground almonds to make a pastry crust . it did n't come out super fine but was adequate for my purpose . i think i 'd depend on how fine you need it . 
no sorry 
no , i do n't think they have those 
no . this bed is terrible . i weigh under 130 lbs and it sinks in permanently quickly . i have had the bed for 7 or 8 months and had to flip it 3 times already and i need to do it again . i just spun it around the last time and you can see the big dip in it and it looks broken down and uneven . i would suggest a different bed . 
no , we do n't feel wires through the sheets . 
i would have to say the coils are evenly distributed . i do not notice any more than the other . 
the plug is three prong 
no 
i bought one couple years ago and it last for about 3 years . and i thought it was because i kept it on in summer . so i am hoping this one will last longer than that if i do take it off from mattress in summer . 
yes . 
first , there are two heat controls . the cord length was a significant design flaw . the cord is very short on the side away from the plug and barely long enough on the other side . 
yes , it is suitable for a walking treadmill without arms - such as the rebel treadmill 1000 - underneath . the desk is very stable , which makes it ideal for use with a walking treadmill . 
the desk does not come with the keyboard tray . you could purchase the keyboard tray separately . 
if a treadmill with arms could fit under the desktop then the desktop would be at a height that would far too tall for most people . ergonomic experts recommend your hands be no higher than ninety degrees from your elbows when typing . 
the desktop is 48 '' wide x 28 '' deep . 
the desk adjusts to full sitting position 
1 2 '' thick 
it took me about ninety minutes but was not exceptionally difficult . the materials are solid . easier than a chest of drawers . 
it comes with yeast . 
bottle says 100 % apple juice concentrate 
dimensions : width ( in . ) : table : 43.31 ; bench : 43.31 ; corner : 67.24 height ( in . ) : table : 29.75 ; bench : 17.18 ; corner : 33.87 depth ( in . ) : table : 27.9 ; bench : 12 ; corner : 51.5 
measuring the top of the bench the short side from end to corner piece is 51 3 8 '' and the long side is 67 1 4 '' these and be placed either way . also note that on the right side of the long seat back the holes are not drilled as long as the required screws ( to save from some frustration use the shorter ones or drill the holes deeper . 
yes i 'm sure you can but i do believe this is just the set but if you look at related products or customer also bought at the bottom of the page it will have other benches 
yes there is ! i did n't know that when i ordered it ! but once we out it together we saw that there is ! love it 
the table is n't attached to the bench so you can move it back and forth . but i am 5'6 and sit comfortably under it at the end . i will say though that the signal outer bench is a bit flimsy . i 'm going to have to have it braced more in the middle . hope this helps ! 
sorry no . this is a set . 
assembly instructions are very clear and detailed and as long as you follow the steps exactly you can assemble this in about 3 hours give or take . the key t the whole process is to follow the instruction step by step otherwise you 'll end up taking things apart . 
one box spring 
don ' t know exactly ... but you can not go wrong this is the most comfortable bed ever ... .you sleep like a baby 
the set i purchased was a queen . 
no . only mattress and box spring . 
yes . 
yes absolutely . 
i had difficulty getting enough steam built up to get rid of soap buildup . it seems a bit underpowered . hope this helps . 
it will take 6 ~8 minute to empty the a container of water ( about 280ml ) if steam continously 
hmm . i have not used my steamer on concrete . concrete is pitted . what is ever in it.. needs a chemical to pull it out ... or a lot of water . the steamer does n't emit large quantities of water . i would first try something to neutralize the urine . look for a pet related product . ** # 1 pet odor eliminator ** urine remover - cri certified enzyme cleaner for old & new stains - free bonus included ... by petseer amazon sells this . it is an enzyme ... so not a harmful substance . as i stated earlier , i think a lot of water is needed to wash the urine away . best to you - s . 
yes 
there are 55 filters in a plastic bag and cost is per plastic bag . these filters are a almost square piece of filter paper with 5 holes , one in the center and one each at each corner . grounds may still get in the coffee by being forced out if the brewing is to fast and you use fine ground coffee such as drip grind . wetting the filter first helps the grounds stay in the filter better . if you grind your own coffee with a course grind then that helps keep the grounds out of the coffee also . 
i believe it would . filters measure 9 1 8 x 9 1 2 inches , that is a good size filter . 
yes , plus shipping ! ! i keep trying to find them locally ; meanwhile , i 'm using tissues ! 
the package does not say unbleached . manufactured by rockline industries , po box 1007 , sheboygan , wi 53081 . 
i am not sure . my stove-top pyrex percolator is a 12-cupper , and when i `` wrap '' a filter around the filter cage spindle all is well even if i put in 10 coffee measures of coffee ( i like my coffee strong ) . the packaging for the brew-rite 's do n't say . if this is really large percolator ( like what they put out at neighborhood meetings ) , you could try it , and merely lay the filter `` flat '' in the filter cage with the middle hole over the spindle . most important is to cover the drip holes ( the ones in the bottom of the filter cage ) . brew rites will probably do this . still think you 're better off trying to find round `` flat '' filters that fit a 30-cupper . 
they were made in china , for an australian company . 
yes , they are labeled on the packaging as `` bpa-free , fda compliant food grade silicone '' 
they feel as though they are all silicone and state in the paperwork they are completely coated in silicone . there is one item that has a metal core but the rest are microwave safe as well ! i really enjoy this product- i have had mine for about a week . 
hi nancy , we have just begun rolling out new colors to our range , including dark grey and teale ( blue-green ) . this product will likely be the next one to get the new colors , so hopefully in store by april 2015. i hope this helps . matt - starpack team 
hi cindy cat - at present cherry red is our only color , but we are looking to add some new colors in a few months time . colors we are considering are black , teale , green and purple . i hope this helps . matt - starpack team 
yes is it . 
does not securely hold an ipad2 with otter defender case . 
dear customer : movement is left & right . up & down . 
it rotates left to right too . there is a joint right behind where the tablet sits that lets the tablet rotate . but the big joints only go forward and back . but you still get plenty of viewing and rotating from side to side . 
no ... it is 4 3 4 inches thick when folded completely up so it does not fold flat 
the unit hangs down 4.75 inches from the bottom of the cabinet . the white mounting bracket is screwed to the bottom of the cabinet . you can remove the unit from the bracket if needed . the white mounting bracket is not visible at all . i hope this helps . 
hi joanne , i was able to put about 25lbs in . 
yes . i brined my thanksgiving turkey in it . 
yes it does . it 's normal position is at 90 degrees and you can push the fan back to whatever angle you want . 
oh yes , and easily . you just pull of the front screen and wipe down the blades . i double love this fan . ( if you have any trouble removing the screen face the fan toward yourself securely and squeeze on opposite edges . it 'll pull right off . ) 
i guess i 'm not sure what the question is . what has probably happened , and amazon is doing this with increasing frequency , is that the someone purchased this fan , found it to be defective and returned it . it should work with the adaptor . if it does n't it is defective . also , we tried two sets of 6 of these fans over two years for our outdoor art shows and they move almost no air . i gave the first set away and returned the second set . 
it tilts forward and back about 20 degrees but is very flexible to adjust . this fan is incredibly quiet , easy to maintain but most importantly it is beautiful . 
110v ac . regular wall outlet . great fan . 
try your local hardware store . 
i have no idea 
no there is no remote , but it is the best side table fan i 've ever owned . worth every penny spent ! 
no - the power switch is in the base . 
china . but the construction and materials are very good . 
i use it on my glass top . it has a smooth aluminum bottom . i have had no problems at all . 
i would n't think so as they seem to be some type of plastic rubber material covering the metal handles . unfortunately , this item shipped with no pamphlet from the manufacturer which would give specs on this . disappointing . 
this does not include a jar rack . i bought one at a local hardware store . 
i have this pot as well as the ball canner . there is very little difference between the two . i use both on my smooth top range without any problems.it will hold 7 qt or 8-9 pt jars . 
yes , but you would have to be making a huge batch . i have used it for making everything from cheese , to apple sauce , to bone broth . 
i have used it on high heat on a ceramic top stove , and i have had no issues . i have mainly used the pot as a canner . 
yes , that is exactly what i have - imported from italy . no damage what-so-ever to the ceramic tile . 
i suppose you could . you would need to drill the holes through the bracket which is a type of hard plastic . you would need to drill those holes in the narrow space between the containers . the bracket is about 1 4 thick but hollow . the mounting they come with works well . 
i ordered and installed just one dispenser . if you have a three ganged dispenser send it back and order three separate ones . 
11.5 '' x 10.5 '' x 4 '' approximately . 
yes and it stays put.my shower is fiberglass and i love it ! its very easy to put up as well.make sure you give it 24 hours for the silicon glue to attach to your shower wall and you are good to go.you will not be disappointed.finally no more shampoo bottles falling down . 
plastic , with metal finishings on the base . 
yes there is glue . anytime you see different colored pieces of wood on one board this is your clue that the board is laminated ... i.e . individual pieces glued together to make a bigger piece . look closely and you will see that the entire board is constructed of many smaller pieces . while most manufactures will not tell you what kind of glue is used ( not even boos block ... the very expensive american made boards , ) it is usually epoxy , which when dry is considered harmless and non-toxic . 
9.5 x 13 , 8.5 x 11 , and 8 x 6 ... the middle one the same as a piece of paper . 
13 '' by 9.5 '' 
we occasionally wash ours in the dishwasher but never use the drying cycle . heat cycles will accelerate aging and cracking in wood products . 
when i received mine ( may 2014 ) the cutting boards were wrapped up in plastic identical to the first picture shown above , and shipped in an amazon box . 
they are very substantial ... 10 16th of an inch ... which is very close to 3 4 of an inch . i am very pleased with them . 
no worries , i did n't even use the instructions and i am mechanically challenged , so you should be fine . you put all of your poles together with the twist out part on the top . put a rubber ring on the pole first then a metal ring , then the basket . your rubber ring slides into the metal ring and the metal ring slides into the basket holding it in place , so just make sure you have the lowes basket on the pole first then work your way to the top basket repeating the above process . when you place the pole in your shower or wherever you want it , just place it in the corner of your area and twist the top of your pole to tighten it against the floor and the ceiling to hold it in place . good luck ! 
3in high , 8in deep , 11in wide 
plastic lock in place covers for the vertical tube work quite well . not sure why but they do . heavy items on one side of basket has no effect on shelf being level . 
installed nov. 13 , 2014 , so i really do n't know . product appears powder coated which is a good coating , has tape to cover joints , and appears to be doing ok but i ca n't positively say it wo n't rust . 
about 3 '' tall 
said to be rust proof , but in my experience they all rust eventually 
i like to make my own dough when i 've got the time . it has worked perfectly with fresh dough but you need to watch the timing for the first few . 
yes . very easy . the tray is removable . i personanally think it wise to spray a small amount of non stick spray on the tray the first time before using . it 's a great machine . 
i do n't know if in germany is 110 or 220 
yes , but you still need to scrub burnt stuff off of it . 
the ul label rates it at 1200 watts , 120 volts ac . hope this helps . it works great ! pat . 
the only temp control is selecting top , bottom or both for cooking . the numbers are minutes . you turn past at least the 15 minutes and then back to the time you want to use . number of minutes needed varies by pizza type . be aware - do not cook two pizzas in a row . it must cool down completely or you risk blowing a fuse that you ca n't replace inside the unit . we have two of the makers in case we want two pizzas . it does the best job cooking pizza of everything we have tried . we also use it for other items like frozen fish filets or reheating burritos , etc . 
actually yes , but remember they will cook quickly as they will be closer to the baking coils . : d just watch for browning all the way around thru the viewing window . can also bake small pies in a pie tin , cook crust first , till lightly brown , then add filling . 
hi mom , i cant say if the 3 compartment divided containers fit , before emailing you i went to store to look for them , i was going to measure with the actual container , but they did not have the 3 compartment zip lock container . i did add the interior dimensions to the description of the lunch box on amazon . the lunch box inside is 7 7 8 '' x 7 1 4 '' x 3 '' . i hope this helps . i have three kids twins 7 and a 10 year old . the biggest reason i did this lunch box is because i was so grossed out with how dirty the soft lunch bags get with the kids using them . we do not use many reusable containers for the lunch boxes because the lids seam to get left behind at school more than they come home . i do understand many people do use the containers so i will compile some more information on what does fit inside and post it . if i can help you in anyway please let me know . thank you in advance , happy holidays , amen wardy owner delicious agent : ) 
possibly . unfortunately , we never sent our munchkin with warm food , so i ca n't say for certain . 
no , not machine washable or dry able . spot clean only . 
that 's a hard question to answer . how large is large ? by the way , i use this cushion in an upholstered chair with arms ( not in a bed ) . i would say that the arms on the cushion do drastically inhibit the seating space on the chair . however , the cushion is very soft and molds to the chair and body . i personally love it - i would love it even more if it did n't have those arms ! ! i do n't consider myself petite , but i do n't consider myself large either - i 'm 5'6 '' tall and weigh 130 lbs . 
i am an adult , and i use it every day . it just needs to lean against a wall , bed headboard , etc . 
the cover is 100 % cotton . the fill is 100 % polyester . 
i am only a 5'2 '' older woman , so i could n't attest to one with your measurements ; however , i would not guess that it would be that supportive for you . i have to have it up against my headboard in order to be completely supportive the way i want . that 's the best i can do . 
no it 's not removeable , but the whole thing is washable . 
yes . each section is 12 '' across and 16 '' tall . 
dear , thanks for your question . about this painting . we also have other larger size : 16x20inchx3pcs ( 40x50cmx3pcs ) : $ 69.9 20x24inchx3pcs ( 50x60cmx3pcs ) : 99.9 if you want to buy , please let us know , we can send the link to you , thanks . any question , feel free to contact us . best vilavi 
it might not be a good idea because of the moisture . 
each section is 12 x 16 
i 'm honestly not sure since i 'm not familiar with giclee print 
not really , only if you want the legs on . we opted to use it without the legs as it fit at the end of my daughter 's bed that way . if you want to add the legs , you just screw them in . the unit is fully assembled otherwise . good luck . 
yes 
i am not home - i will check when i return- it sits on the floor at the foot side of queen bed- it is just smaller than the width of the bed and at least 18 wide- it is quite large . 
this product also comes in red and black . 
no sorry , it can countdown from a maximum of 99 minutes and 59 seconds . if we included hours on the timer the digits would need to be much smaller and based on feedback the size of the digits was more important that counting down from 2+ hours . 
it keeps beeping for a few seconds , perhaps 15 - 30 , i have never counted . once it beeps and finally stops , it does not beep again as a reminder . 
2 3 4 '' x 3 '' 
i do n't know about the 30 second time ... .but when i use mine for a 30 minute time it will set itself for another 30 minutes ' 
no , that 's one of the really great features about this model . 
even on high speed the water vapors last twice as long . also , the `` cup '' for the medicated vapor solution is multiple times bigger and not as awkward ( it actually is more like a cup than the strange odd shaped reservoir on the previous model ) . i replaced both of my vaporizers with the new ones and have been extremely pleased 
the old version had a small opening to refill the water . water would spill over as i tried to refill it . the improved version has a 3-4x larger opening to fill water . this is convenient as you can use your tub spout without having water spilled over . the second biggest improvement is the heating element . in the old version , the heating element had the caked on calcium deposits and i had to soak it with vinegar for a day or so . after using an old toothbrush to brush it off , the element deposits was not 100 % removed . for the new version , the calcium does get caked on , but i can pretty much remove 100 % of the deposits after soaking it in vinegar . other than that , the two versions are the same . i 'm inclined to buy another new version to replace the old one . one is used for an upstairs room and the other one for the downstairs room . 
you can barely hear it . when it needs to be cleaned it gets louder . a little vinegar , and it 's quiet again . my daughter sleeps with it going , she 's very light sleeper . 
it shuts off when there is no more water . 
warm only 
you lift out the water reservoir and flip it over and fill it .. very easy to do because it is light and has a handle . 
i think so , for a while i put vicks on the swab and made my own method of menthol . it really most about having moisture in the air . hope that helps . 
12 '' long 10 '' high and about 4 `` wide . nice to take lunch in 
yes it does 
i bought this , and checked on the bag .. does n't say where it 's made 
it does not have a content label attached , but i suppose it was made in china due to the fact that it shipped from there 
i 've had the same problem with this product . the problem i 've found out is that the plates inside the unit that make the ozone need to be recharged periodically to continue to make ozone and this product does not have a way to send the plates back to be recharged so when it 's no longer making ozone you 've got a rather expensive thing on your hands that does nothing . the company needs to remake the unit so the plates can be removed and sent back to be recharged in a way that is cost effective . i 've got 3 of these . the first ran for a long time , the second quit making ozone after only a couple of months and another i bought on ebay that was used and lasted a few months as well . i 'm trying to find a manufacturer that makes a unit that lasts or allows recharging . this is the coronal discharge type of ozone machine and perhaps the one that makes it with a uv light would last longer . i may try that next if i find one for a reasonable price . if your problem is that it no longer discharges ozone , otherwise , it may just be some physical defect in the machinery . 
here is what the manual reads : power input : 110 vac 50 60hz ( 10w ) or 220 240 vac 50 60 hz ( 12w ) . the unit will come with either 110 vac or 220 240 vac . you just need to specify which one you want . 
i think i understand what you 're trying to do here . i drink lemon water in the morning too , very refreshing and healthful . you 're trying to combine two drinks into one . in this case , however , i do n't think it will work . ozone is a highly reactive gas ( i 'm not a professional chemist this is just what i 've read ) that 's why it is used to sterilize things ( like plastic where heat ca n't be used ) . i think the o3 might destroy the healthful benefits of the lemon and destroy itself in the process . i 've always read that you should take o3 water on an empty stomach and then not eat for at least 30 min lest the food in your stomach destroy the o3 , this is the procedure i use ( i 'm not a health professional this is just personal experience ) . 
the manual says two minutes . i just do a half gallon for ten and put it in the fridge . i usually finish that in two days . 
we`ll i really do`nt know for sure if you can paint it.my felt apart within . a month . 
yes we do , if you search bunk junk you will see all the items we have for sale . you can also go to a la mode jewelry storefront . thank you for your interest in our amazing camp products . 
it is 24 '' tall 113 4 '' wide 12 '' deep . 4 drawers over 10 '' wide 11.5 '' long and 5 '' deep . remember it is cardboard and can not hold heavy weight . good for undergarments or for light paper storage such as bills and recites . 
nope 
i have queen size . 
i love love love this bed set ! ! ! its more of a dusty rose than pink and it is exactly as described ! it 's very soft and cozy and washed dried beautifully ! the two toss pillows that come with it are super cute ! ! i would buy them separately if it werean option ! ! i chose to use a medium sage green sheet set and wow it is gorgeous ! i would rrecommend this set for the price ! ! it 's a win win ! 
thanks for your question ! i did a quick search of our catalog and we do n't have this item available in full size . you might like to browse the 'customers who viewed this item also viewed ' section of the detail page for similar items . i hope this helps ! 
60 x 30 
30in x 60in 
yes it is from the disney store . 
they are flat , but the handles get very hot , which is not mentioned . 
i called t-fal and checked this out and yes it is made in china . according to the company the sets labeled elegance are induction ready pans . if it has copper bottom it can not be used induction wise . 
as far as i remember , yes . 
the tops of the handles get warm , and the closer you move to the actual pan they tend to get pretty got . 
not at all . buy some barkeepers friend and they will stay clean . 
yes the lids fit the fry pans.. 
no it does not come in contact with food . the aluminum base is a separate piece on the bottom . 
no they are not

it makes 4 waffles , each roughly 3.5 x 3.5 inches square . 
no ... but make sure you use a spray oil without lecithin ... thays the ingredient that causes a sticky smelly buildup on non stick surfaces . i prefer bak-klene from williams-sonoma or a similar gmo free lecithin free spray from a chef supply in your area ... 
yes i have washed them in the dishwasher and they are fine . 
no where on the box does it say it is bpa free . it says it is food safe . made in china . who knows . we bought it as a joke since our son always wanted a `` taco truck . '' 
no , just the standard . 
they are approximately 5.5 '' x 3 '' x 2.5 '' and you get a set of 2 , one salsa red and the other guacamole green 
just corn so far and they are great ! 
according to the label , 2 amps . 
light hair , light dirt . definitely not meant for a deep clean 
its separate 
yes , it does . 
yes 
i believe it would . my little dog tracks in sand and the dirt devil picks it up . 
thank you for your inquiry . the assembled dimensions are 34.5 x 11.88 x 12in ( lxwxh ) . 
just right to hold the bottles ! ! ! can not measure since not at home but i bought two of these several months ago and have been most pleased . 
it is 12 inches , great item . i bought 2 sets and right now have 30 bottles on it , and it is very sturdy . 
yes you can 
no , this fits standard to 750ml wine bottles . 
not electric but auto 
yes , this item is can be purchased with a natural gas nozzle attached instead of propane . 
hi joyce i'am king sorry about the delay , yes you can control the 2 tanks . great fryer good luck 
do n't get this fryer i 'm returning it , it almost caught me on fire , it like blew up because they did n't attach the piping correctly , actually the piping was barely attached and as the gas went through it was leaking and i tried to light it and blew up a ball of flame ! 
china 
we no longer have it would not be good for a food place inside 
either one i got mine on metal it have rubber feets on it . 
the fryer has a standard 3 4 '' connection for propane supply . your tank connects to a low pressure propane regulator ( sometimes a first stage and second stage depending on your setup ) and then to the fryer . 
yes it does . a 24 pk variety pack of kcups . everything you need to start when you open the box . 
black with grey trim 
it 's plastic . 
no thermometer , just a knob that slides from left to right . 
no , the trays are fixed . 
it does have a plastic grease tray that sits under the front of the grill . it is not attached to the grill . 
i 'm not sure of the exact temp , but i do n't think it 's very hot . i cook everything with the slider all the way to the right ( hottest ) , and , unless something is wrong with my foreman , i do n't think it is as hot as it should be . 
it has 6 trays . i was able to thinly slice 2 apples and a single banana . we did n't plan to a lot with this product . 
it is bpa free . thanks ! 
not that i have found . the unit has only an on off switch . i have n't had any problem with the temperature . i just check periodically to see how the drying is going . it has worked well for us so far . 
i have dried fruit and jerky with very minimal sticking if any . the non-stick trays , i believe , would be more for drying purees . 
i do not think there is a weight limit . these chairs are extremely sturdy and comfortable ! 
slide up to point in chair on arms to the point it sticks out . 
it has a comfort level of a park bench . it 's not a super comfortable chair but i can sit on it for a while without any issues . 
just measured . 20 1 4 '' . and that 's from the widest point of th chair . 
one of the nice things about this edgestar unit is the entire unit will shut off when the selected humidity level is reached . most comparable unit 's fan will keep running and only the compressor will shut on off . the edgestar shuts all the way off making it less noisy than other models . 
yes it does and it works perfectly . 
i did and it was n't a problem 
as you face the machine , it will come out of the right side . mine actually blows toward some house plants i have and they have benefited from it . btw i run this 24 7 and it performs like a champ ! i have mine draining into a 5 gal bucket and i ca n't believe all the water it removes from the air in the house ... great for here in damp oregon . regards , jwm 
it is 110 115 volts 60 hz only . 
i think i purchased an extended warranty through square trade . 
the unit needs to be higher than the drain initialy -- -once it starts draining thru the hose , the unit can then be set on the same level as the drain 
the shark multi-floor steam energized cleanser is discontinued in all stores . it is currently sold out not available online or in any store . any customer who owns a shark steam mop , etc is aware that the steam energized cleanser is crucial to have in conjunction with the steam mop or it will not properly clean and the steam mop will not work with other cleaners . the small amount of multi-floor cleanser that is still being sold is the remainder of the discontinued product . it is sold at a higher value due to many sellers having to purchase it in other countries such as canada , uk , etc . it is a higher value now due to the high demand of this product . it is the only product that can be used for shark steam mops . once , they are not being sold anymore , many of us will have to wait for another type of cleaner that shark may or may not come out with soon . 
i would say no , it does not even work on my shark but it was listed . i am done with shark products , they are cheap and flimsy 
the cleaning sprays in front of the mop . it will have a different sound and you wo n't see the spray come out . hope that helped . i love my machine ! 
approxt 5-6 rooms per cleaning 
this product is out of stock for a while now , very limited quantity is available . 
bed bath & beyond is less expensive than most places i 've looked ( use their coupon . ) best buy also carries it . 
i ordered from amazon prime , 6.29 each bottle , i did order thee bottles . 
no . all copper . 
hi scott , thank you for contacting us . these mugs measure 4 inches in height . thank you ! 
hello , as with many copper items , our mugs are made in india . thank you for your interest ! 
190 grams 
this mug is made of 100 % solid copper metal sheet and are neither lacquered nor coated or plating . this mug is well treated in state of art advance technology laboratory and it is fda approved for drinking purpose . 
9.5 '' vertically between shelves . for the purses i store the depth of about 7 inches is a bit small but check if it will work for you . let me know if you have more questions , janet . 
yes . you can by it with wheels . 
11 1 2 from wall , 24 inches wide , 65 inches high . each shelf is 9 1 2 inches deep 
black is all i saw , and it was the one i was looking for . 
you can do both . if you connect a garden hose it will bypass the bucket . 
this is the new 2013 model with energy star . all other recall batches were made during the previous years . 
yes , if the humidistat works . mine did n't . 
yes , it is threaded for a regular garden hose to hook up to it . 
yes it does . it slides out from the top . 
yes it does 
a small adapter hose comes with the unit and you attach that to a regular hose and run it out to wherever you want . it is a great unit ! 
yes 
they are removable . when i considered doing so , however , there are three bolts on the bottom that protrude a bit beyond the bottom . it looked to me that the unit would be stable resting on the bolts as they were spaced far enough apart but i am using the unit on a polished floor so i decided to leave the wheels on . 
yes . 
no , we have had ours almost a year , and no problems , i just fluff it before i crawl in bed . you will not be disappointed in these pillows ! we love ours ! we even take them in the camper with us because we sleep so good on them ! covers wash great too ! 
never really had a bad smell . 
yes i still put a pillow case over top even though it has a cover but you would n't have to 
i just made the purchase . it was for my husband and he gave me his review . i have not yet tried to clean the pillow . 
no 
it does not need to be refrigerated . it comes in a plastic sleeve . it sat on my counter for a month . 
i froze mine for a month before i used it and it was fine . 
i used it on a regular frosted cake . 
yes 
yes , the very bottom is metal 
not cordless . 
no . you just hear the water boiling sound . and it just quietly , automatically turns off when the water is ready . 
according to the box it came , yes . 
i believe they only recommend heating the water as you are not supposed to submerge it to wash it . i would n't brew tea in it but it would be nice to be able do that and reheat your tea ... 
yes - top rack . however , i do not use the dry cycle on my dishwasher . do n't use the dry cycle if you are putting these in the dishwasher because i ca n't guarantee they wo n't melt.. i love these . this is my second set after 8 years of using the first . one of the magnets came out of one of the measuring cups and i melted one side of one on the stove , so had to get a new set . 
they say `` made in china '' on the cups . 
yes . thanks ! 
they are very flexible so you just open side or push the bottom . plus nothing sticks to them so it is easy to take everything out . they are not melting and not giving rubber smell or taste . i like to use them in baking , so easy to take cupcakes out without damaging them . 
the same size as standard paper cup cake liners . 
i think they would work well , and they are more sturdy than other ones i have used . 
there are no markings on product or information in insert as to where they are made . you might try contacting the company through their website . 
13 x 20 x 19.8 inches ; 35 pounds 
yes you can and very good drip coffee 
unfortunately no . i have to put the unit on the end of my cabinet and fill from the side with a pitcher . 
the connector on the machine for the milk frothing pitcher is made of some type of plastic material , as well as the pitcher . i believe steam enters and exits the pitcher to work the frothing mechanism - there are two little hard plastic tubes for this purpose . the brew group is also made of plastic and metal . if you are concerned about possible impact on taste , i do n't detect any plastic in my coffee . nor are there any smells that would indicate warming or melting of plastic . probably best to contact philips if you are concerned about specific plastic compounds that are used inside the machine . 
the machines sold in the usa come with the right cord and work on 60hz 110v . if you are thinking to travel to another country , especially in europe you may have to puchase a transformer to bring the voltage down from 220 to 110. the frequency difference will not affect the machine except for the clock that will not keep the right time 
very quiet compared to other machines such as the de longhi 
i guess so . this is a mini idali stand . 
the height of the stand is 6-inches 
yes , but size of plate is very small . 
i know that some of my bigger plates do not revolve like they did in my old microwave.the plastic type stand moves the plate then it bangs on the door . i love this microwave for my needs and that is the only fault with it.i would buy a bigger size for 11 '' 
10.3 is height , from counter top to top surface of machine . 13 '' is from your wall to face of machine 
it happened to me i broke microwave tray before , and it was complicated cause the factory would not sell the tray separated . at that time , i found a web site specific , googling `` microwave plates '' . they would find any try for any model and brand , but it was around 50 $ the tray alone . i never contacted this specific factory cause i did n't need to , but sometimes it a better to use the microwave without tray as long as you can and then order a new one . keep an eye on the sales ! 
it has a three pronged plug . 
hi . yes it does . thank you ! 
i would never put anything over a gas range . there is always that mistake from someone turning it on , and destroying the item on top . 
yes 
i would say approximately 24-30 inches . great if your electrical outlet is close . i bought it for my son who is in college and he likes it . 
18in long . 10.5 high . 13 wide.using standard box measurement.wide is front to back . 
you should freeze it for a minimum of eight hours . bob b . 
i dont see why you ca n't ? it just freezes the liquid between ice . 
29.50 not a good deal 
not that i 'm aware of , it comes as a package deal 
they 're machine washable . they recommend washing 2 at once to even out the load but one could substitute a towel if you only have 1 . 
hi rk , our pillows do not have pbde 's . we manufacture our pillows in california , not china and do not have any pbde 's 
this one is great , is does n't sink lower than a couple of inches and still cradles your head . if that 's what you 're looking for , go for it . 
i dont have to keep turning this pillow around to find cool spot like many of the pillows ive had in the past ... i get a supper nites sleep on this pillow , , , , , i know it may seem a little pricy but it is worth every penny in my openion , , , , , mike 
i have had mine for a couple months now it is a king size . i have also bought the queen size for my bf.. we both love our pillows.. i plan on buying 2 more . 
no . it 's too thick 
perfect . its work very well . 
work with an lg split 
it works good ! 
i have no idea . i got it for a trane ac and tried out all 3 codes but it did n't work out ! 
no 
yes it will 
yes 
yes 
yes , you should be able to . 
no , i never had one 
yes it is 
yes . either side can be exposed . 
yes 
of course , mine is 50 '' and fits just fine . great product 
47 ' for one unit 
hi beth . i would say it is slightly matte laminate . i love this console ! i have it set up similar to the picture and it 's beautiful . 
yes it can , but its not really wide enough to be really used it as coffee table 
12 3 4 `` 
they are separate pieces that you can adjust by moving the piece that sits on top wider or closer together . it 's really cool and very modern looking ! 
yes , does a great job on hard floors , my only complaint is about dog hair on carpet . the power nozzle is not very heavy and i question the performance on carpet . 
no 
it needs just the nozzle you see in the picture which is a turbo nozzle . turbo nozzle means it has a powered agitator but instead of an electric motor the agitator is turned by air moving through a fan in the nozzle which turns a belt connected to the agitator . better then stright suction alone and not too agressive for bare floors . 
the wand can attachto the rear of the canister ( sort of a t shaped tab on the back of the nozzle which fits into a slot on the back of the canister ) so it does not fall over if you have to walk away or get interrupted . 
no , it 's 110v . 
the description box reads 15-7 8 '' x 7-3 8 '' x 4-3 4 '' 
yes , with inches to spare on both sides . 
it possibly could but this is more so better for makeup 
one might be able to put a curling iron straightener in the center section , standing up . a lot depends on just how much and what kind of `` hair stuff '' you are referring to . in my opinion it is better suited for makeup accessories and as i mentioned a few hair items , depending on the size and quantity . 
i think it is real wood . it 's too light to be mdf . 
i really do n't know . 
i 'm sorry i ca n't as i gave it as a gift to my granddaughter who lives out of town - the next time i talk to her ( couple of days ) i will ask her - sorry 
according to one reviewer , the drawers are 2 '' tall , 3.25 '' deep , and 4.1875 '' [ ~4.25 '' ] wide . 
it fit a 1 2 sheet cake leaving appox a 1 inch boarder all the way around it was very nicely done with really vibrant colors 
the edible sheets have a shelf life of 12 months when kept in a sealed bag . so you can order yours today even if you do n't use it now . be sure to keep it in a sealed , airtight zip-lock bag . they do not need refrigeration ! keep the image at room temperature , out of any direct light 
you write your own dedication and print it onto the labels that have the b.g image . prime shipping direct 
it runs ... not pretty . we had to put room temperate bottles of water on a table and people seemed fine with that . it was the winter time so having cold water was n't a necessity . 
yes , i used them for the smaller bottles . 
no they are not 
it 's a throw size , approximately 50 x 60 
it 's `` lap '' size - 50 '' w x 60 '' d 
i purchases 2 of these throws for my daughter 's birthday . she has had them since february 1. she brought one down last weekend and it looked perfect . however , i do n't know whether or not she has washed it . they are very pretty ! 
the vitamix 750 , g series , is shorter than the original vitamix 5200 , c series , and claims to fit underneath overhead cupboards . however , it does not fit underneath my overhead cupboards ( maybe my cupboards hang down lower than other cupboards ) ; if i take the lid off it fits . it does not create a problem for me because i do have an area on my countertop without overhead cupboards . you can measure your spacing ; the unit is 17.4 '' tall . 
not sure . 750 is the artisan series only sold by higher end kitchen stores . has better book by the actual chef and the biggest 2.2 hp motor as well as 40 % quieter than older versions . 
with a converter 110 to 220v it should work 
vitamix 750 
no , is not hard , like any other blender , still you can always take the parts off and scoop from under , i recommend you the blender 100 % is my most beloved appliance in the kitchen ! : ) is not hard to scoop no worries . 
i 'm not sure about the pillow top . i do n't believe it matters though . i purchased the king size and it fits nicely . my temperpedic mattress is about 8 '' thick and there is plenty of room to go higher . there should be room to for the pillow top . i love mine ! do not put in dryer , you have to hang to dry . the rubber backing will start to peel if you put it in the dryer . 
it has definitely helped , but i still get hot at times . 
not sure . the top is almost terry cloth feeling i 'm sure the bottom is waterproof as my son wet the bed and it did not leak through 
i believe in china 
i recommended this for my daughter who is also potty training her little girl . they have deep pockets so it should fit over any mattress . i do not dry it in a hot dryer but on a lower setting.it does not make you hot at night . i highly recommend it . 
yes , all the way around 
no 
there is terry on top and a thin layer of some kind of super soft and flexible `` plastic-like '' material on the underside . the sides are a shiny , stretchy fabric . 
the temperature range is from -58 f to 572 f . 
no 
i do n't know , but i ca n't see why not . the probe is made of steel . 
no it is n't . 
yes 
no , you 're not supposed to get the electronic head wet at all . 
have one , but have no idea on the warranty 
no 
it depends on how far the temperature is from where you begin , but i think it 's pretty quick 
i do n't have a textured tub but i would think it would actually adhere better . great mat 
yes it is . 
no it does not have any smell . 
hi liz : the tranquility bathmat has small holes in the surface of the mat for effective drainage . therefore , it is remotely possible that hair may wash through the small holes and collect , but we have not heard of specific issues from our customers . i hope this answer helps . please advise if you require additional information . 
no , you have to run off the wort from the grain into another vessel for boiling . unless you are doing some sort of biab . 
you do n't need to worry about it.the top of the false bottom is above the outlet valve and holds the grain up so the mash flows through the outlet . 
yes , it has a false bottom that can be lifted out . 
inside diameter is 13.75 '' , inside height is 13.75 '' , bottom is thick and laminated , i guess for even heat distribution . it is well made , you have to install drain and thermometer . ignoring price and rated from 1 to 10 i would give it an 8 . 
18 inches between legs . 
15 x 20 
i never use it , but i measured it and it is as follows : a rectangular pull out of 4 3 4 inches by 3 1 2 inches on the right side , with a hole of 3 inches in diameter , which contains a 1 inch deep cup of 2 3 4 inches in diameter . the cup fits easily into the hole in the pull out shelf or you can push it down further to make the opening about 2 inches deep . i have n't tried it , but it seems a little risky for heavy containers and or beverages . like i said , i never use it . 
unfortunately not , the table can only raise up to 28 inches high . 
hard to answer without knowing the height of the bed and how you would use in said bed . i use it in my living room directly in front of my easy chair sliding it back over my legs to eat or use a laptop or whatever . i had to adjust the legs to reach just the height that i felt comfortable for its use . it slides easily on my floor so no problem with that , but all these things are variables depending on your own location and use . i can say that if you are looking for the sturdy long type of hospital table that wheels over a bed for that type of use , this is not it . this one is smallish and less sturdy but my apt . is small and for me this does the trick . i do n't think it would serve well as over the bed type table . better off looking for the more substantial hospital type wheeled table . 
yes , the table can fold up to lay flat with collapsible legs that you swivel inwards and lay flat . it is about 3-4 inches thick when folded flat for storage . 
table top measures 20 '' x 15 1 2 '' 
hi , lani . i got two of these , and they are really nice . it is square 11 1 4 '' x 11 1 4 '' , but the molding around the base of the organizer takes it to 11 3 4 '' ( in case you 're trying to squeeze it into a corner or something ) . it is 4 1 2 '' high in the front and 6 '' high in the back . the drawer is about 5 '' deep , and there is a hole for the wires in the bottom of the organizer as well as a compartment in the back ( with a hole for the wires ) that opens up . hope this helps ! 
the entire back is open . without having it near to measure , plan on the width of the cabinet , less ~ 1-inch for the combined side boards . also , the slide-out drawer is not full depth , so you have 3+inches behind it . i have a lot of wires extension cords stuffed behind it , and still able to slide tight agains the wall , hiding all of them ( except for the outlet on the wall ) . i hope that helps . 
you would probably want to use shelf brackets as this is rather heavy . another possibility would be to mount a wall shelf and put the organizer on the shelf . you 'll want access to the back of the unit in order to insert or remove the chargers for your devices . 
yes ! a power strip with 4 outlets fit in the back and it nicely hides the cords and just the power strip is plugged into the wall . 
an ipod can sit anywhere you want it to , on the top or bottom shelf . 
power strip not included 
i charge a nook tablet . a hd nook tablet . a droid phone . a nook e reader . i 'm capable of charging simultaneously , however they overlap . i do not care as they all are on charging station but there are not slots just tiers . the end result is my electronic life is charged and ready as a result . 
not at this time , only white . the organizing place 
40 watt 
it is for underneath the microwave . 
2 '' x1 '' 
i replaced a 30 watt dwe 125 volt bulb with this one in a microwave and it works satisfactorily . the glass envelope is a little shorter than my original bulb , so it will fit in a more compact space . it is rated at 40 watts , so it will produce more light and run a little hotter . in my amana microwave it is working without a problem . 
yes it was 
it is on most of the time at my house . if your bulbs are burning out after a few weeks it may be that the mother board needs to be replaced . 
i purchased it for my maytag over the range microwave ... model # mmv5208ww 
no 
not sure but it worked in my whirlpool microwave which operates on household current . 
not for what you are wanting . its for three video devices ( bluray player , xbox , ps4 , etc ) and allows you to switch between the three to view on one screen . but i had no luck with this product . like many others complaints i have read , it came to me faulty . i sent it back . 
automatic switching never worked for me , and i do n't believe there 's an . option to turn it on or off . 
it is made from canvas on a stretched frame ... .so i do n't know if it might be effected by the heat ? ? ? ? it is beautiful though ... sorry if that does n't give you the answer you are looking for . 
it 's really hard to tell . it is 3 sections of canvas , but my best guess is that it is printed . it is however so well done that it looks like a painting . we really love it . 
one pocket sandwich ! you use one half of the slice for the top of the pocket sandwich ( imprint of the animal ) and one half for the bottom where the filling goes . then you lay one half on top of the other and seal it . one slice of bread yield one pocket sandwich . 
i honestly think they are way to small to be filled . everything falls out . 
it will work , but the images wo n't be as clean or be as visible . the cheap bread works the best , unfortunately , it is not so good for you ... 
hi there - it is the actual comforter package that has a clear plastic zippered top and pink material sides and bottom . the package is lined with cardboard to help make it sturdier . i hope this information is helpful . please let me know if you have any more questions . thank you for shopping and take care . divine frills 
hi candelaria - i am sorry but i do not normally carry the full size of this comforter . let me know if you want me to check to see if i can find it for you . take care and i look forward to hearing back from you soon . 
i do n't think so . 
no the base is metal and does not scratch my wood floor 
22 '' - we really like them . 
ive never measured exactly , but i have really tall friends and really short friends and the chair has never been a problem . just lift up or down as desired . 
it 's adjustable to whatever hight you want 
no these are super simple to put together . they look great too 
hi there , i purchased these stools for the sole purpose of using it as a prop at a kitchen & bath show . i do not recall seeing any yellow tinge to it but then again we only used it for three days . i went back and looked at the photos of our booth and the stools seem pretty clear to me with no yellow tinge at all . hope this helps . 
thank you for your interest , these stools do only come in sets of 2 . 
250 lbs . 
depends on your water source and how much you use the maker . we change ours every 3 months 
they did n't say . but they are too large and misshapen to fit into my keurig . 
i have used this type of replacement filter for about six months . each filter seems to work as well as the name brand . i see no difference - except price . 
sorry , do n't know 
i believe they are 
yep ! the vue and the standard keurig both seem to use the same filter holder . i actually am using a filter holder for an original keurig in my vue , and it 's working just fine . 
yes 
it hasnt yet . 
i do n't see it anywhere on the cookware . unfortunately , i 've tossed the box away . 
oven safe no- dishwasher safe yes . great non stick surface ! 
hi , i am sorry it took so long for me to replay ... i do not see any information about cadmium on or inside the box 
if you click on the picture the description on the box says that it is : ) 
hello steven i bought this set before three months ago and my wife always praise the set either for cooking or cleaning . but i wish there are different colors . regards 
yes . as long as it is in a wall stud . 
it does not - but its a great can crusher , i love the way it crushes the 24 oz and bigger cans . 
i't will , but it 's not recommend for that . it will probably break it . it 's for al cans only . 
u can try but i do n't think it will because it does n't completely crush cans . it crushes them to about the height of cat food cans . it works well if u have tall cans . 
yes , it will crush the 24 oz cans . 
mine has been outdoors in rain for 3 months no problems yet but the unplated allen bolts have surface rust we just put a little waterproof bearing grease on top of the bolt heads 
you can only use one pod at a time , but it does n't take long to brew . 
this tru single serve pod coffee maker takes the melitta ( senseo used to make them originally ) . the individual pods are round , about 2 3 4 inches from edge to edge . they are a soft paper filter material with coffee sealed inside . amazon sells the pods and by subscription is the best price i 've found . there are usually about 18 pods to a package . 
the reservoir holds about 5 cups . it is easy to refill or top up , and has a clear indicator for the water level . 
you can probably buy them right here on amazon - search for coffee pods i buy some from quill.com - donut shop coffee in both regular and decaf is delicious . 
yes , you can . i fill mine from the filtered water from my fridge . 
when you remove the bottom you could fit a 4-1 2 '' cup and that is the tallest . 
the booklet inside reads : `` one year limited warranty '' . 
adjust cup size and brew strength with the digital brew control and enjoy a fully customized cup of coffee in about a minute . 
no . it is very hard and scratchy , fine for feet but not for sitting on . i actually scrapped an elbow on it . 
this depends on the surface prep . with good adhesion we expect the product to last up to 5 years . please read through the instructions clearly before applying for any necessary surface preparation . 
hello . thank you for your inquiry . yes , our spray grip product will adhere to trex decking . the surface should be thoroughly cleaned to remove any dirt etc and perhaps a light sanding prior to application to ensure good adhesion . please advise if you have any additional questions . lisa ( slipdoctors ) 
hi mary , each unit will purify 500 - 1,000 sq . ft. of space depending on existing air quality in your space . i hope this helps : ) . 
yes it does , for the smoke smell . obviously if you have something dank lying around you will still be able to smell that . 
very simple . unplug the unit first . 1 ) push the button near the top to access the filter . flip open the top of the unit . 2 ) to remove the filter unit pull up by the handle . 3 ) use a soft cloth , warm water and mild soap . do not submerse the filter in water or rinse directly in water . use the cloth to remove the dirt from the filter then rinse the cloth often to remove the debris and soap . repeat as needed ! 4 ) very important : only touch the filter by the handle and most of all the filter must be 100 % dry before you install it back into the unit . once the filter is dry slide back into the slot gently do not force it ! the filter will only fit one way . 5 ) close the top and snap it shut . plug in the unit and you 're good to go . hope this helps . 
the first couple weeks i kept it on at all times . now i just had it on when we are sleeping or if allergens are high . the air remains fresh in the house . i also do not have to dust as often because it has cut down significantly . 
hi brigitta , yes , the purifier works for pet dander . however , please note that purifiers do not work like vacuum cleaners so it will not remove dander off all surfaces like a vacuum cleaner . purifiers can only filter the air that passes through the unit . i hope this helps : ) . 
i currently have one in my daughter 's room because of her allergies and my family room . both are pretty decent size rooms . 
it is clear , smooth glass and it is sturdy -- not a thin delicate glass . 
yes they are . they 're great ! 
yes 
15 '' wide x 19 5 8 '' long x 24 '' high 
it 's wooden , but it 's design prohibits too much weight . that being said , i think it could handle 20-30 pounds without a problem , but i would n't stand on it if i did n't have to . 
yes , it 's easy to assemble and required no extra tools . it only took about 20 minutes . 
it looks like real wood , but i suspect it 's particle board with a great finish . 
overall : 19.5 '' l x 15 '' w x 24 '' h ( these dimensions are available under `` product description '' ) 
yes . must be rinsed well ( obviously ) . 
the lid comes off but i do n't know whether a cone would fit properly . i 'm on vacation and ca n't test it out . 
no . this carafe is stainless steel lined . 
china 
i just can say that my oggi device is not useful to carry away to outside because its lid leaks.it leaked all over floor of my car.i am not sure all of the products having same problem . hopefully i gave enough info about it . 
no 
i have n't had to do it yet , but i am going to use my vacuum cleaner brush tool and vacuum the front and back with it . 
actually , if the item is found to be defective , the manufacturer will pay for the shipping on your item both to you and back to them . the customer is not required to pay for any shipping charges . 
onli if it is on 
you can set it so it does not oscillate 
it tells you in the product details : product dimensions : 6 x 6 x 38 inches ; 9 pounds 
i have not tried the hard candy yet . i have assembled the two halves , piped chocolate into the hole for the stick and then inserted the stick . 
3 to 4 
yes 
yes , small glass ones that work fine 
it is pretty thick when you take it out of the package . a couple inches i feel , but i feel it went flat pretty quickly . i weigh 175lbs . and have a couple 8 - 11 lb . yorkies that sleep with me . it was okay , but i was looking for more plush than this . i think it is good , but just was looking for more . 
i am not sure what a sleep number bed is but my husband and i sleep on a sofa bed and are so very pleased we bought the extra plush mattress pad it has made our bed very comfortable indeed . we can recommend it . 
yes in fact , i think it does . i do n't wake up hot like i used to before i got the mattress . 
we 've had ours for 2 months & it 's just as great as the day we bought it . 
more fluffy . i bought it to put on top of a memory foam mattress because i was going from a 30 year waterbed bed to a 'real ' bed and i could not adjust to the firmness of the softest memory foam mattress . it added the 'fluffy ' i needed . 
not sure if it 's entirely possible to completely eliminate some shift but i 've found that to ensure a tighter fit , i pile on more than one mattress pad . i got this idea from a 5-star hotel that had the most amazingly comfortable bed i 'd ever slept on ... i took the bedding away to find that they had three pads on the bed . once i tried that at home , i was hooked and my pads do not shift . good luck on that . 
totally fitted and with ample fabric for my 18 '' , memory foam topped king . have to add this product is probably the best one i have bought to date . surp assed the quality of my previous ralph lauren and ck . a great buy ! 
it 's not very heavy , maybe 6-8 lbs . 
i doubt this would work very well on a water bed mattress , however you could ask the company who is very easy to work with 
the pockets are probably close to 30 inches . i have a 22 inch mattress and it fits that with room to spare . 
not much . i had a small flat screen computer monitor , keyboard , and mouse on it and it bowed in the middle within a couple months . do n't waste your money . spend a little more and buy a better table . 
yes 
no , the legs are not adjustable . it stands 28 '' high . it is very sturdy . 
not very about the same thickness as a card table . the exact measurement is 1in 
it is almost 2ft 1 2ins . it 's 28ins total . perfect for a side table to store amp and all extras for that you need . would n't suggest to try and use for a dj set up to short 
it is light , yet sturdy . probably weight is listed in the details for shipping ... the leg clips are extremely tight when it comes to taking the table 'down ' ... 
20 '' wide , 48 '' long , about 28 '' high 
as far as i know , it should fit evian bottles perfectly . in my case , i 've been using kirkland water bottles and work just fine . 
mine came with two , but i imagine that it can vary depending on where you purchase it ? it told me in the description on mine that it was coming with two . 
if it fits . it 's designed to fit loosely on the top of regular clear water bottles . 
yes . the filter extends down into the bottle . without it , there is no way to draw water up into the device . 
yes . the filter extends down into the bottle . without it , there is no way to draw water up into the device . 
yes the filter not only cleans water but acts as a straw to get water up to the humidifier 
no , it is part of the operating unit 
more like a faded black , i think . 
yes ! as a matter of fact i just washed them this weekend for the first time . i line dried , all looks good . these pillow are beautiful ! do not be afraid to order , you will not regret it . 
the estimated dated is defaulted by amazon , we can not change it , you items will arrive at you in 8-14 days , thanks . jastore 
it is , but it 's not my favorite . i 've gotten used to it for napping , but it 's actually a pretty rough material . i 'd suggest a different one . 
on my cuisines rat coffee maker there 's a plastic insert with a place at the end to snap in the filter . the water passes through during brewing . 
per my user manual , yes the dcc-rwf will work with the 1100 series . 
totally ! they are 100 % identical to the ones that came packed in with my cuisinart coffee machine ( which has `` designed by keurig '' featured prominently on the box and the machine itself ) . they work great and are soooo much more reasonably priced ! 
yes , you need to have the cusinart keurig coffee maker , these are the smallest filters they have , the newer machines have larger ones 
mine is a dcc 2218. i believe it fits any 2200 numbers . 
yes , that is the coffee maker that i purchased them for 
yes and yes , i am really happy with the quality and fit ! ! never buy any other brand again . 
do n't know . i bought them to fit my cuisinart dgb-600 
sorry i do n't know 
yes , ours did . whip , bread hook & general beater . 
the measurements are 12 ' in . high x 12 ' in long x 6 ' in . wide without the bowl and 10 ' in . wide with the bowl . you had the option of purchasing the extended warranty for 2 years at an additional cost . ( 15 $ for 2 years i believe ) the standard warranty when i purchased it from wal-mart is 1 year . 
not that i know of . the bowl that comes with it is designed to lock into the base . 
ours is not . did n't find a switch to chang to 220 . 
cr2032 
this is a single timer , but at this price you could afford to have more than one . i have two now . 
the timer will chime for 60 seconds at a rate of about once every second . after that , the timer will begin to track how long it has been since the initial timer expired . during this time , it reminds you every 30 seconds ( roughly ) . i did n't count how many times it will remind as i got annoyed and turned it off . suffice to say , 4 minute after the timer initially expired , i was getting a reminder . 
no 
that 's a great question . although there are similarities , rest assured that we did not copy them . our ceramic mandoline slicer has a different design ( especially along the sides ) . it is sturdier . also , the handle is different . 
no extra blades 
approximately 1 16 of an inch , though there is a little variance . i hope this helps . 
no , it is not . 
mine fell apart the second time i used it . 
actually no instructions are needed . these are very easy to use . you only have to worry about the thickness of your fondant gumpaste . you simply press this on top of your fondant . 
the item just can be shipped to america abroad . hope for your understanding . 
the roller is similar in size to the 9 '' wilton roller . this set is a great deal . i teach a beginners deco class and i use these tools for them . 
just what you see in the photo . 
works better . the only drink that is not the greatest is the one that they have on the box . the rainbow one . other than that , the recipes are amazing and it works great ! 
there 's no app for the kindle 
it includes the scale , the tablet phone stand , 2 pouring spots , and a stainless steel shaker . 
sorry it has no date anywhere on it or the box . 
yes it will . wo n't look as nice as on the ipad because of the smaller screen but works the same . 
you can not use the scale for inventory purposes , but the app that you can download for free will keep track . 
yes 
no 
yes 
without the handle - the area is 14 '' x 14 '' - with the handle it 's 22 '' x 14 '' 
hi kim , you would be fine . as other users have said , the contact is minimal to none and exposure time is very short . we have a long history of happy customers using in much hotter settings , including big green eggs at 750 - even wood fired ovens . just keep reasonably away from flame . gary @ exo super peel 
david , the handle does not detach . it is quite a bit stronger this way and is quite thin , so stores away readily . 
i has a combination . the mixed colored beading , two different shades of red , dark and bright , and the sequence comes off more like a burgundy . personally i think it is a beautiful piece . even my husband told me he really liked the piece . i am very pleased with it !

yes , its not clear ( lens ) but it actually is as if the lens has a outdoor filter lens which you can see through . well made , really real looking , dishwasher safe and an actual thermos . 8oz i would think . a nice gift or for yourself . was impressed actually with the item . 
no nothing moves on the cup ... 
no , the base is plastic 
run it under hot water . it happened to me to . 
maybe 5 inches ? i gave it as a gift , so ca n't measure it now ... 
the blanket is 60 '' l x 45 '' w it is a really good size , i even cuddle up with too ! 
not super plush , but i 've washed it several times and it 's still soft . my son sleeps with it every night . 
46 '' x 60 '' 
the current image is wrong ! ! i requested that amazon change it to the correct image . it has 4 tmnt characters and it says good times . they will hopefully change the image shortly . 
the inside dimensions are 59 inches wide , by 46.25 inches heigh , by 41.5 inches deep . 
this is n't an official answer by any means , but i do n't think you can . the bed has a different method of attaching it on the stairs side than it does on the drawer side . 
59 inches in length , 42 inches in width and 46 inches in height 
the chests can not be replaced by poles . the bed is very sturdy . i do n't think poles alone would be enough to support its weight . on the bright side , the drawers come pre-assembled so it is much easier to put together than i originally thought . 
the lid is attached , it does not come off as part of the design . however if you want to cut the plastic to remove the lids , that is certainly something you could do . the organizing place 
yes . the organizing place 
yes you do . each drawer a separate case , hinged at the back . 
you will have lots of room ... ... each case measures approx . 14.4 '' l x 14.1 '' w x 3.1 '' h 
each case measures approx . 14.4 '' l x 14.1 '' w x 3.1 '' h 
i have been watching this for a while and reading every comment possible to discern if this was the original ( not frosted ) pattern ... ..it is not the gorham ribbon edge ii frosted ! it is similar to the 2007 discontinued style ... .probably a little more shiny . 
i love , love this gorham pattern . it is ribbon edge and on the in light it says vietnam ! never noticed the country but i still love this beautiful gorham stainless . it is heavy larger than my onidea pattern which have had about 45 years . truly beautiful ! ! ! ! 
had to return my 89 , as the offer said golden , but it was stainless color only . meanwhile , have purchased 2 place settings elsewhere and quality not good ... vietnam . i am seeing some offers out there now for korean ... .might better try those . 
they are heavy but i think they are hollow . 
32 oz size bottom = 5-1 2 '' across lip = 7-1 4 '' across bottom to top of usable space before lip riser = 2 '' bottom to top of bowl lip ( without lid ) = 2-3 16 '' bottom to top , closed with lip on and closed = 2-11 16 '' this by eyeball and metal ruler metal , so best effort accuracy these will nestle one on top of the other and not slide around - if you try and want more , do amazon search for nc-729 select seller webstaurant store and then view the alternate item that pops up , which i believe is this item in bulk pack . my wife and i love these ( we 're retired ) ! 
these are recyclable , microwavable and freezable type 5 polypropylene resin plastic . there is no bpa in polypropylene resin plastic regardless of the end manufacturer or product . so neither these reditainer products nor those of another manufacturer that uses the type 5 polypropylene resin plastic would contain bpa . 
i want to say they are usa but not 100 % sure . 
no 
for a short time , not for serious freezing , the seal is good but not airtight 
about 2 ft off the ground.good size to sit in when playing , , , 
my son uses the chair and he weighs approximately 210 lbs 
oh yea of course , im 6'0 '' 193 but the system in there sucks ! i bought my own speaker set and replaced them and added a subwoofer in the bottom compartment and now its the way i hoped ( : but was dissapointed when it first came in 
yes , i did n't like them . you can see the paper around the cup . it 's put together cheaply 
yes 
they do not come with lids or carrying case . they come in a paper box and you have to purchase the lids separately . i bought them for myself . 
i gave these as a wedding present to a couple i hang out with quite often , and they said they really liked them and used them often . they drink a lot of coffee . therefore , i am assuming they are safe for coffee ! 
no and no . tumblers only . 
yes , just spoke to customer service and they will send you one call 1-800-672-6333 mr. coffee parts 
it is pretty quiet , much quieter than my last one was . 
no , the bvmc-hc5 is designed for making hot cocoa . 
i do n't think you can ... it is just for hot chocolate . 
just cocoa and other drinks from mixes , like chai 
yes , i always use it with milk.. regular milk works best . i have used almond milk also but it does n't turn out as well . 
no . i put it directly on the floor and unless you are on your knees you wo n't feel the floor . i 'm 6 ' 3 '' 185 . 
the amazon specs show shipping weight as 26.6 lbs . i 'm a 5'3 '' grandmother and it was very easy for me to handle compared to a traditional twin mattress . 
the mattress has a cover that you can remove by unzipping it . other than that there should be nothing stopping you from cutting it evenly with the proper tool . 
yes , it does . in fact , it 's much more compact than it looks in the photo . i also have the breville juicer and the hurom is overall less space-consuming . 
no - it is strictly a juice . if you are really interested in juicing then this is your unit . if you want blended fun drinks then get a blender like vita mix . 
what 's the drum bowl ? ? 
do n't buy this , it is not worth it . you ca n't juice anything that is n't hard . 
korea 
model hj-dbb06 
good quality ? from china ? yeah , right . : ) 
this is my issue . i just received the item and no where on the package does it state it 's bpa free . in fact , there 's no company listing on the package , all the writing on the package is full of misspellings , grammatical errors , and nonsensical phrases . i tried to google the company to make sure they were n't just sticking bpa free on the description as a catch phrase and can find nothing on them . i believe i 'll be sending these back . 
each lithiumlife battery will power the vacuum for up to 25 minutes . it comes with two , for a total of 50 minutes . how long is that ? http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=yls4ic52snk 
we have thick carpet but not long strand it works well but not as well as regular vac 
it does lay flat , but it needs about nine inches to go all the way under , because of the battery on the front . 
3 hours or less . 
it works on my two bedrooms with carpet but mainly i use it on hardwood and tile floors , , , it has a selection that activates a curled brush roller that seems to work on carpet ok 
this set of cutters is for the kitchenaid grinder attachment that connects to your kitchenaid stand mixer 
no , i have n't noticed any metallic residues . i have used my grinder attachment many times since purchasing it . 
i ca n't really say anything about the gaggia classic since i have never used it . i can tell you that i am partially satisfied with the capresso . i do n't particularly like the design of the 2 portafilters , especially the one designed for one cup . the instructions say that it requires `` practice '' to use it properly and it looks from all the reviews that everybody has the same problem : coffee `` spraying '' out in all directions . manual says that skills of a barista are required to use it properly : so basically they are trying to make the user feel totally inadequate to justify what seems to me a bad finicky design . the steaming wand is good although it only has one setting : on or off . you can not regulate the amount of steam like in other espresso machines . all in all it is ok. not the best . 
there is a tamper that comes with the machine ; however , it is made of plastic , has an odd shape , is nearly 2mm smaller than the bottomless portafilter , and is hard to get a proper grip on . if you 're like me , you 'll find yourself having a hard time getting it to tamp flat . this is n't a big deal with the pressurized basket , but if you want to use the bottomless portafilter , i would say a proper stainless steel tamper ( of the proper size ) is a good investment . i took some measurements : the tamper that it comes with is around 49.5mm and the bottomless portafilter has an inner diameter of roughly 51mm . i was just eyeballing with a ruler , so do n't take these measurements as exact - i do n't have a caliper lying around , so i ca n't get more accurate than that . i bought a 51mm tamper ( measuring with a ruler , the tamper 's actual diameter looks to be 50.5mm ) , and it fits almost perfectly . there 's just barely a half millimeter of give when i put that tamper in the bottomless portafilter , as opposed to nearly 2mm of give with the tamper it comes with . i took a few pictures of the measurements and will upload one each of the tamper and the bottomless portafilter shortly . 
no afraid this too is made in china even though the company , capresso , is in new jersey . 
this is not a professional grade appliance , it has no nsf marking , in fact on the bottom it says for home use only .. 
i 'd say it 's about a quart . it 's enough to make about 4 to 6 drinks depending on whether you stream milk or pull longer shots . it is removable , very easy to refill and transport . 
i believe it is . not 100 % positive . i love the machine . cappuccino looks just like ones we had in italy . 
if you cover both the mattress and the pad together , you will need the extra deep sheets . the regular sheets are too small . 
the dimensions of our twin sized toppers are 39 '' x 75 '' . 
i have blue side up . very comfy 
the density of this memory foam is 3 lbs . per cubic foot . 
the dimensions of our toppers is 38 '' x74 '' . we design our toppers to be smaller than the actually mattress dimensions , to avoid sticking out of the edges . 
yes . the middle section does not recline however . 
if you want to recline , you should be a couple few feet away from the wall . 
at absolute most i 'd say 35-40 degrees from being a completely flat 180 degrees . i hardly ever find myself actually leaning it that far though . 
no 
very hard if using foot . 
nope , pretty short . i 'm 5 ' 10 '' and my feet hang off . i was pretty surprised how short they were 
very comfortable to lay in . i find that opening the recliners makes it even more comfortable . 
it all depends on what your into . some people enjoy a big mouthful . 
it slides in nicely , but it 's a tight fit . 
not at all : ) 
no , they are 2 separate pieces that do not connect together . 
i would say yes it does at least in the sense that it does not make you hot at all . i found that my older memory foam pillows made my head sweat only . i changed to the microbead pillows and that is no longer a problem now . 
not sure of the exact dimensions but we have a queen size bed and it fits it perfectly . i thought the dimensions were written on amazon when i purchased it . it 's very comfortable and we are very happy with it . hope this helps a little bit . i recommend it . 
yes but it does n't take that long 
31 inches 
hello , the seat height is at 24 inches . best regards , netrush 
hello , yes , these stools do swivel . best regards , netrush 
yes . the refillable coffee filter is included 
i always do since it makes clean-up so must easier and faster . i just place the tea bag in the little plastic cup where you would notmally place the coffee grinds and then screw the top part over it and voilla , you are ready make a lovely single cup of tea . nothing could be easier . i purchased two since once the rubber flapper stops sealing i have another one i can use . best thing since sliced bread . i hope that this helps you . 
i have both this and a keurig vue brewer , and i 'm thinking about selling the keyring since i use this daily . i 've noticed that it is faster for me at least . my tap water gets super hot very quickly so i do n't have to microwave water , but even that would just take about a minute and a half . also i 've tried the same flavor type of coffee in the vue brewer and the my jo , and i enjoy the myjo more . it does n't taste burnt like the vue often tasted . but it does brew a tad weaker than the vue brewer , but i prefer that . i 've tried iced tea , cocoa , and apple cider pods and they turn out great . 
any brand will as long as they would fit in a keurig 
yes it is 
yes ... 
no . the bottom of this is 9 '' wide with an additional 1 '' slope . ( think pie pan ) 
the inside diameter is 9 1 4 '' and the outside is 10 5 8 '' . the spigot on my dispenser does not reach over the edge . but the stand is so pretty , i kept it and use it as a cake plate serving dish . 
yes . 
yes according to rubbermaid website they are bpa free . 
yes it does ! 2 i 'm fact , one for each side 
no 
i know exactly what you mean , but there is no option to control the temperature . 
it 's 31 inches wide , 25.5 inches high , and 11.25 inches deep . it 's a very nice piece , and puts off a decent amount of heat . i hope this helps . ml 
yep : - ) a lot times i just need to knock the chill out , so i 'll just use heat mode alone . 
there are fans in the back that pulls air in over the heat coils blowing air out the front . if you put against the wall it ca n't breathe and the fans will over heat . 
no , but we 'll pass the idea on to the manufacturer 
i have a 40 inch flat screen on top of mine and have had since i bought it about a year ago . i made sure that the wheels are sitting on some small pieces of board to make sure it is stable and the tv wont fall off because soft carpet is unstable . 
well we have a 1 story . 1440 sq . ft home it heats it nicely . i have a terminal illness and have to keep my bedroom door closed as it heats it up . we have an open space of about 900 or so square ft. where the heater sits it heats up in about 15 minutes before it spreads to bedrooms . hope that helps 
yes , i would not have particle board 
yeah just unscrew the back to take it out 
flames - sort of . looks real to me and my wife . as for the bulb . i hope mine last for a long time . 
same thought i had and finally am bartering to give it to my handyman . i was astonished at the lightness . you would need to have some sort of heat resistant paint for the opening where the heat comes . out . a shame , because the flame effect is great . went for a smaller one by another well-known brand in cherry and black . 
yes , i think so . mine 's been perfect . check to see if you filled it over the max line - it will spurt and sputter in that case . 
no - this kettle is amazing . i really do n't know how i lived without one for so long . and their customer service is tiptop . 
1.2 kg or about 2.65 lbs 
no 
the blue light turns off and shuts the pot off as well . the water boils very quickly . there is a small click sound as the light turns off so you have to keep and eye on the water . 
about 5 minutes 
i do n't know whether it is exactly lead-free . you would need a lab test for this answer if you do n't trust the seller . 
blue 
no . not adjustable . it has a draw string close but the actual carry strap is not adjustable . 
hi miriam - hopefully other users chime in with their personal experience , but as the manufacturer i thought that i would offer my suggestion . this is a big laundry bag for sure . as far as too big ? ... that is tough to answer . when not in use , it can be very , very small as it folds up in to a tiny 'footprint ' . you also certainly do n't need to keep the bag completely full for sure . just put a manageable amount of laundry in for day to day use . we decided to offer a bag this big because we saw a lot of other reviewers on similar products that were on college campuses or military bases . those folks needed a bag with a shoulder strap ( we solved that ! ) and needed it to be really big for trips home from school or when travelling away from base . your question is subjective , of course , but i hope that i was able to provide an adequate answer . chris k keeble outlets 
yes ... i washed it in cold water and hung to dry ... perfect 
about 24 inches 
first of all this is not a small bag , these hold a ton of stuff . there is a very large grommet at the top of the strap and across from the strap on the top . for if you wanted to double tie it . there is not one on the bottom of the strap , but it is well made and is holding up . it also has a draw string at the top with a plastic piece that keeps in in place ( i forget what they are called ) and that is nice as well . keeps everything inside in case the bag falls over . after weeks of hauling salon towels , holding up great . 
this pitcher pours very well . over a month of daily use and nothing has dribbled down the side yet ! 
it does n't have to be glass to make sun tea . just clear . so yes , it would work , 
you made me get out my tape measure . it appears that it is 12.5 '' including the lid . 
the pitcher is not made of glass but of , `` stain , cloud and odor proof , durable , high temperature material with glass-like clarity '' as stated in the description . it is some type of plastic . 
yes it is . i still hand wash though . 
12.5 '' of gloriously majestic pitcherness ... 
no . this product is meant for 120 volt outlets and we do not recommend the use of an adapter . 
you can use it for cheese fondue but oil wil crack the crock pot . 
space for a spoon to stick through . 
yes just like regular crock pots -- and you can put the crock in the microwave to reheat things quickly as long as you do n't put the lid on it . 
two ovals 7 '' x5 '' . very useful for warm dips , gravies etc . harry krebs 
they are one quart each . 
sorry we do not have this juicier in 220v . 
hi eric , the 220 volt is not available in the us at this time , and as we understand it , there are no plans to bring the international model to the us for sale anytime soon . harvest essentials does offer other omega juicer models in 220 volt however . 
hi there , the nc800 and nc900 are not available in 220 volt in the us market at this time . there is no estimated date or commitment for either of them to be available in the us at this time . 
would have to measure it but it fits a double bed ( that is what i bought if for ) just fine . plenty to hang over the edges and to tuck the end if need to looks great 
i have washed in washing machine and it came out fine ! 
74 x 86 for the full 
there are pillow cases like the sheets and two like the comforter same swirl pattern 
100 % polyester . machine was cold gentle , no bleach , dry tumble . it has a little sheen to the fabric . it washes well . 
if you 're looking at the front- ( where there is a silver circle button to turn it on ) , turn it around , and the lower back side , where the silver bottom is higher up along the blue , there is a tiny little button , that if you push , it pops open the battery chamber . just turn it around , and feel the silver back side , and you 'll see : feel it . it 's super easy once you see it . battery directions ( + , - ) are written on it , and labeled on batteries as well ! let me know if you need more help ! 
i heat almond milk for about a minute in the microwave , in a glass measuring cup . frothed up fine for me . 
it 's made in china . i would not waste my money on the epare milk frother . a better buy is the aerolatte frother ; i have two of the aerolattes that come with a travel case ; they work great ! 
it does not come with a stand . 
i do n't think it is strong enough to do stuff like beat eggs or whisk cookies . it is great for mixing my coffee with cream though . 
yes , you have to 
i have found them to be very sturdy and very attractive 
i 'm not at home right now but they are a large square maybe 12 '' maybe ever bigger on all sides ? i 'll check when i get home 
225 
no , it 's just a fan and filter 
no . 
there is no large filter , ,it uses 3 `` b `` filters by holmes , ,the prefilters fit on the side of the b filters , the best prices on the b filters are on amazon , ,for about $ 25 for 2 filters , ,you willl 3 , ,they are available at walmart for about $ 10 more 
not that i 'm aware of . 
there are 3 hepa filters . they suggest replacing them every 6 months . the charcoal filters that cover each hepa filter are supposed to be changed every 3 months . 
so far i have not notice that issue . i have two of these machines running 10 hours a day and they are working better than the last ones i have that i had . 
well - the bottle tends to spin with the motion of the opener . you would need some way to secure the bottle so it would n't spin . if you did that , it could be done with one hand . 
you have to get the correct ac adapter 
on the adapter is reads , 120v ac 60hz 50ma ... ..hope that helps . 
it comes with a power cord when pluged into both the wine opener and an electrical outlet charges the unit . it will then open approximately 60 bottles on that charge . you should not leave it pluged in all the time as that will over charge the battery and ruin it . 
i have used it with the plastic corks with no problem 
yes . i use it a lot . 
ca n't answer specifically but the one i got from amazon a few months ago looks exactly as pictured on amazon . 
i never try it , but i think it can . 
email joyoungusa @ hotmail.com to find the answer . 
if you have a smooth , polished steel ( not brushed finish ) or chalk board paint surface then i would n't use these magnets . they stick so hard that the only way to remove them is to slide them to the edge of the fridge and pick them off from there . i have a standard white fridge and the magnets work fine and have n't scratched anything . 
i would think so , depending on what you 're trying to glue them to , but i have n't tried it . the magnets are really strong . i would definitely test it on one first to make sure the magnet does n't pull away from the hot glue when it 's stuck on a metal surface . i used the craft glue because i wanted to make sure they were really hard to pull off since they 're on magnets for kids to play with . 
they are very strong magnets but you may need a few for a 3 pound tool . will definitely work well for screw drivers , wrenches , pliers , and ratchets . hammers may require 2 depending on the weight . 
you probably can but may not like the outcome , the magnets are so powerful they will pull away from the fabric 
as for the weight i know it can , but some stainless steel is magnetic and other types are not . so it really depends on what type of stainless you have . hope that helps . 
i believe it might be a too strong . i think one magnet in the center of a 2 '' x2 '' tile would work perfectly . 
hello - i am not able to give you the weight capacity but can tell you the bed has met all the astm safety requirements for weight capacity . my understanding is the bed is tested with 400 pounds for a short period of time . this does not mean you should put 400 pounds on the bed . in general , beds that meet the astm safety guidelines have a recommendation of about 200 pounds of distributed weight per sleeping surface . of course this will depend on many factors such as kids being kids and jumping up and down in one concentrated area or the thickness and quality of the mattress . i hope this helps . scott 
it comes with slats for secure mattress support , no box springs needed . just add mattresses and you 're ready to go ! 
dimensions : 98.5 '' w x 57 '' d x 63 '' h 
good morning julie - it would depend on what part of the country you live in . the further away from florida- the longer it will take . in general it takes 2-7 working days . if you are in a remote area of the country it may take longer . i hope this helps . 
hello roy - the dimensions of the bed are 67 '' high x 57 '' deep x 78 '' long . please keep in mind you will also need room to open the drawers under the staircase . hope this helps . scott from dreamscape furniture - feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you have more questions . 
chris , the handles as you see in the pic are separate and are joined to the oper part . this is a very efficient and easy to use hand can opener . also the turning piece is soft to use especially if you need it . it opens the with not effort . i highly recommended . i do not let anybody else use it ... it is mine ... : ) 
yes , it pierces the top of the can but it does it very close to the edge so that virtually no sharp edge is left on the can . the lid is removed and discarded and its edge is quite sharp . this is not a safe-edge opener such as the `` good cook classic 4 in 1 can opener '' . 
i believe it is and it works great for me . 
i bought this for my elderly sister . she has arthritic hands and she told me she loves it . i have not used it myself , but i would definitely buy myself one on the strength of her recommendation . i hope this helps you . 
well it 's made of stainless steel so it shouldn't.but i would wipe it dry after each use and it appears to be very sturdily made and should last for years with minimal care . my wife liked it so much she had me order a second one definetily head and shoulders above the ones we used years ago ! 
23.6 ( w ) x 15.0 ( h ) x 21.7 ( d ) 
it 's about 6 feet . 
it is hard . lift and pull out from the left side bottom of the panel , not the main frame of the unit ( the very bottom ) . when closing it tuck in the left side top of the panel and snap in the bottom . not the best design . 
window unit i believe ... 
yes ... i think most do these days 
yes it does . works great 
yes . 
yes 
hi there , it is a 1 oz + 1 2 oz . thank you for the question . regards , stuart 
no this is not an insulated shaker it works like it should but condensation will appear on the outside so wiping it down before a pour allows you to not add excess water to a good drink 
if you fill it to the brim it holds about 2 1 2 cups or 20ozs . i fill it halfway with ice then add the liquids usually a jigger and a half of equal parts so it makes the right size cocktail . hope that helps ; d 
the shaker i received , the strainer is built into the lid , it 's one piece . when you shake it , there 's a lid that fits over the strainer.. it 's a very snug fit ... .no spilling ! 
no 
yes , it 's a mechanical power switch not digital so it resumes after restored power . 
no . it just stops when the container is full . i wouldnt honestly waste money on this product again . we use it in less than 400sqft ( a 34ft travel trailer ) and it 's not enough . yet it takes 12 days to fill the tiny container . it 's not super efficient . 
nope , i run it in my small bathroom with no noticeable effect in temperature from this running all day long . it really keeps the area dry though ! 
you should be able to pull it back out . maybe fish it out with a pair of tweezers ? 
no , it is a 110v appliance . 
yes . i use one in the bathroom but i also use a fan during the shower . it takes time to work but it does remove a lot of moisture from the air . 
i do n't see how you could . the tank is adequate in size and dumping it is very easy . you would n't really need to have it drain automatically . 
ac power only . no battery option . 
the manufacturer , bellissima , responded back that this product is bpa free ! ! !

the largest is 14 inches by 8 1 2 inches . the middle one is 11 1 2 by 7 inches , and the smallest is 10 by 6 1 2 inches . they are smaller than i thought they would be but i find them very useful . plus , they do n't seem to stain like my old ones did .

hi leeann , unfortunately we do not . thank you , 
hi carmen , this product will fit most bed sizes , twin , double , full size and at most a queen , but it might be stretching it . hope that helps . thanks , 
yes it does , i bought two of these and they are really good value . hope this helps . 
you can if you can hang it high enough . it 's a lot of fabric but it could easily cover a crib and it definitely keeps out the bugs ! 
it 's like thumb tacks 
hi michael , this is really meant for twin , full , and at most queen . hope that helps . 
if they were really big cupcakes i think so . it measures 5.5 inches across but the sticks that attach it are at the widest 1.5 inches apart .

you screw two screws into the wall and the board slides over the screws . it comes with a paper mounting template , the screws and spacers so you know how far to screw the screws into the wall . it 's really easy . 
it is a continuos magnetic field . you do not have to search for the magnets . 
they are very strong , it is difficult to remove them actually . but they are made for a stable kitchen environment . 
you could try and use some heavy duty double sided tape , or glue it to the fridge with heavy duty glue . down side is will it hold the weight of your knives ? also what happens when the fridge breaks down do you loose the wood with it ? things to think about .

my son actually built it - he said it took about an hour and was n't too hard . he is 24 and quite mechanically inclined . the cabinet is really good quality and looks great . 
hi julia , yes these mats are 100 % bpa free . they are made from a fiber glass weave coated in premium , food grade silicone that is fda compliant . i hope this helps . regards , matt - starpack team member 
hi mary , these mats are made at the top silicone manufacturer in china using the highest quality , fda compliant silicone . the quality is comparable to big name brands like silpat , but are better value as you 're not paying for the brand . we hope this helps . if you have any further questions just ask . thanks and regards , matt - starpack team member 
i 'm not sure why you 'd want to , as these mats are for baking . dough : yes . hot glue gun : not so much . 
best things about opti grill is you do n't have to worry about it- the lights and beeps will let you know . we did turkey burgers from frozen to cooked in less than 10 minutes . we did a chicken sliced in half the other day . took 37 minutes- longer since it had bones etc.- but it was the juiciest best grilled chicken i have had in a long time . the skin was golden brown- almost like fried chicken but less grease ... .i highly recommend buying this item . 
you get the grill marks like you do on most grills . i have not noticed the top or bottom being hotter then the other so i would say it cooks well on both sides . now when you use the word `` crust '' you must be asking about its ability to sear ... that i have not seen this grill do . the only one that i know that does a great job at this is the breville http : www.amazon.com breville-bgr820xl-smart-grill dp b003sin0bc ref=sr_1_10 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1401304965 & sr=8-10 & keywords=breville 
if you put the food on the grill before it indicates it is ready to cook it will automatically switch to manual mode . i learned that the hard way . so the proper steps are : 1. power on . 2. select type of meat sandwhich . 3. press ok. ( if you are grilling frozen meat select the frozen food option , which is the snowflake button ) . 4. wait until it warms up which should be indicated by both the slow flashing doneness light on the right becoming steady and a beeping tone . 5. put your food on the grill and close the lid . you will then see the doneness light at the right turn blue . it will change color and alarm at each doneness stage . for example . when it gets to rare it will beep and the doneness light will be yellow and progress all the way to red and well done to which it will give you a different alarm continuously until you press ok. hope that helps . 
mine did that once i unplugged then ran through the steps again , power on , select food type and it started working . if you are cooking multiple items where you are pulling food off and putting more food back on the grill you have to shut the power off then power back on select food and let it go through the pre-heat stage again . hope this helps . 
oh my , yes . and better . so easy to clean . i make very fancy paninis in mine . perfect every time . 
when you here the the beep `` do do do da do '' it has preheated and you put the meat on then , it is blue while preheating but when you put the meat on it turns green and starts the cooking process . hope i helped . 
when i purchased my grill a year and a half ago i did n't get any steaks . 
there is one per package 
yes 
i machine wash mine . it 's not as soft but i just ca n't own something like that if it ca n't be machine washed . 
because this is a clay pot , they can not withstand immediate high heat . they will crack . the cooking temperature has to rise slowly . as an example , i would cook my beans by putting the pot in a cold oven with the food in it and let the pot get warmed as the oven warms to the temperature it 's going to cook at . as for cooktops , i would think you could but you would need to use a good sturdy heat diffuser and start your heat low until the pot is warmed and then increase your heat to cook your food . 
hi virgina , our cazuelas are made from very fine clay and may be used after slowly bringing some water to the boil and need no further curing . the cazuelas do benefit however from seasoning it prior to its first use , which can be simply accomplished by adding a couple of peeled garlic cloves to the boiling water use to cure the cazuela . the seasoning on the surface will increase with use ; adding its signature flavor to the items cooked in it , and over time actually become naturally nonstick and requires low maintenance . hope that helps . ancient cookware 
the inside cooking bottom is glazed . 
that is correct . the bottom outside area is unglazed . by the way , the part that is glazed is glazed with 100 % lead free glazes . 
2-they are large-the size of a tangerine . 
a : ok , this question sounds a bit obvious , but i have found there is a `` best way '' . - attach the two pieces of each ice maker together first , before adding water - use the best quality water available ( filtered , boiled , reverse osmosis etc . ) - carefully pour water into the top hole ( use a cup ) and leave an empty space of about 1 centimeter all around the hole . the empty space needed because ice expands . - chill the ice makers in your freezer for several hours . if you want them solid all the way through , allow about 3 to 4 hours . you could also chill for less time if you want to leave a liquid center . i found that boiling the water beforehand and then adding to the ice ball mold makes clearer ice , but that may just be me . try it out . just make sure to use good quality water rather than tap water . 
i filled each ball with 3 0z . of water . 
2 ! it 's worth it ! ! ! 
perhaps you fill them too full ? above the fill line ? mine work great . 
no 
i find this matress does tend to be warmer in the summer . i use a very thin mattress pad to isolate the heat . 
i have not seen any indentations . it it still as `` tall '' and straight across the top as the day we bought it . 
no it is n't removable 
seems to fit exact queen dimensions , 80x60 . no problem with sheets or bedframes . 
i went for the platform bed without a box spring and have zero complaints . 
i would say yes since it was rolled up when it was delivered

we thank you for your interest in south shore furniture . the tools required to assemble the furniture are a hammer , a standard screwdrive and either a phillips ( star ) or a robertson ( square ) screwdriver . we do not suggest to us a powered screwdriver 
all the shelves , except for one , are adjustable in height . so there is no problem accommodating tall binders . the depth is sufficient for large three-ring binders , so they sit pretty much flush with the edge of the shelves . 
i 'm sure it could . it is made of pressed board with a nice white finish . you may have to sand it a little or put on a primer coat , especially if changing color . i am very happy with the one i bought .

do not spend your money on this product . i purchased it directly from the manufacture and regret it . does not work . could not get a representative to speak with me to return the product . scotts liquid gold is still the best . 
i was n't pleased at all with the product ... ... ... . i would n't use it on my marble ... ... .. i think it was supposed to be used on wood 
the bottles are 12 ounces each . 
yes , it froths half & half - does a great job ! 
both concern the amount of milk you put in the machine . one is the limit for froth milk the other is for steamed milk . 
i do n't think ssh . 
the end result will be the same . the aeroccino plus has a handle and a pour spout . also it is slightly shorter and wider inside . the aeroccino 3 has no pour spout and is taller and more narrow inside . they both preform the same way . you would be happy either way . 
if it 's slightly different , it is likely a paddle for lattes . it 's designed to produce a bit less froth . 
yes it does . that is how i was introduced to the machine . my daughter had one and she uses almond and soy milk . both work . the almond milk tastes a little more earthy when whipped up and hot . but i do n't drink a lot of it , so that may be normal . as a side note . i do n't know how i got along without this before and my latte bill has dwindled to nothing . 
hot and delicious . there is also a cold froth option . 
no . i put them in an empty yogurt tub . 
each mold can hold exactly 4 oz ( 1 2 cup ) of liquid when filled flushed to the top . however , you will need to remove about 4-5 tsp of liquid for the lid to close to keep the liquid in . 
we want to acknowledge that we also received your question through our website . our product is made in china and pass all regulations for safe use . 
the humidifier works with a usb outlet on a computer . most wall chargers for ipads have 2.1a outlet power , which is more than the power from a computer . so it should work with a ipad wall charger . 
the company has them . you should be able to email them from amazon . hope this helps . 
yes 
no , this humidifier does not have a switch to turn the light off . 
yes , i have found wall usb chargers can be found for as cheap as a $ 1 . you can find them at most stores . newer cars already have the usb port , same with computers . you can plug this usb cable into any usb ports . 
all 4 inches of the mattress is memory foam . it 's a little firm , but not like a tempurpedic . 
twin size sheets fit the size i have . 
i ordered the 6 '' thick version . i unzipped the cover and you can see 4 '' of regular open cell foam that 's quit firm and a 2 '' layer of tempur-pedic type memory foam glued on top of that . 
probably not . this mattress is longer than a standard twin mattress . 
folds with cover 
i have been sleeping on this for several months ; i do not notice any lingering smell . 
they are about 16 inches , same as an adult hanger . 
10 each i a pack n i purchased 5 packs at least ... .i love them ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
did n't read the label . but the quality is awesome . 
yes , of course . 
yes it can . just watched a review on youtube actually with same subject before seeing your question here . he compared the 600 & 900 watt versions . he blended celery ( +a little water ) for same amount of time ( 20 sec ) , then he poured each thru mesh screen , both models left no evidence of stringy bits , only smooth fine pulp . hope this helps ! 
i have had it for about a month and have used it twice a day without a problem . the o ring came out once but was easy to put back in . i went ahead and bought a couple replacement just in case it happens to break . as long as your careful about what you put in it like too much frozen fruit , dates and the like , you should be ok. when it has trouble mixing , just take the container off and shake it , which you may have to do a couple of times as well as add some liquid . always clean everything as soon as your done by rinsing under hot water and dry it . most of problems people are having are caused by themselves pushing the unit to hard . it never takes more than 30 seconds to blend anything . go on youtube for ideas to . enjoy 
it does n't chop up frozen fruit and seeds well at all . 
i use mixed flash frozen berries which gives me the same nutrients without having to worry about fruit either spoiling or running out . i mix with silk almond milk for further nutrients & a smoother smoothie . both give me the coldness and eliminate the need for ice so my smoothies are more nutritious and taste less watered down . also if you do n't use filtered water for your ice cubes , you can get a bleachy taste and chemicals from treated water . if you still wish to use ice cubes , there is no set number , it all depends on keeping your ingredients below the max line , which is another argument against their use as they take up so much space . 
it 's easy to wash if you can get it to work : - ( 
yes , it is true to size . i love this crock pot it is one of the largest ones i could fine . i searched a long time . works great . 
so sorry this took so long , i was out of town . this pot is slightly under 5 inches deep . its a great slow cooker . d 
i believe it was china 
not that i know of . the cooking chamber is ceramic . the rest is aluminum , plastic and glass .

i would contact the company directly . i am sure they sell replacement parts . 
do n't know . never tried them . 
no 
they are shipped in light grey only . the dark grey black color you see in the photos is how they will appear after you season them to prepare for cooking . seasoning is done with oil , usually sesame . this turn the bowls dark right away . instructions for seasoning are included . 
liquid capacity to the brim is 32 ounces . they are 7-1 4 inches across the top . 
the directions are in the box , first you have to season them in the oven and after use you just wash and dry 
i tried to google for help , and found some discussions but no definitive instructions - 1. good cleaning with warm hot water . 2. cracking the stone bowl seems to be a real concern , and i can see the possibility with fast uneven heating of the bowl if it has a crack in it already . 3. no seasoning is necessary as with the cast iron cookwares . 
the bowls are made in china . 
hi there , i am not sure how many ounces they hold but could probably handle 16 oz . or more . they are the perfect size for a noodle bowl ( entire package of ramen , broth , and additions . ) think very large cereal bowl . i hope this helps . 
can not discern thickness , but it is not enough to function well . ie , during cold winter in ne us , it blows into the warmth of the shower . the bottom magnets are not heavy enough to keep me from whacking it away in frustration . swearing loudly does not help restain the billowing . 
hi amy , there are 12 grommet holes in this liner . it is a wonderful liner , i love mine . 
i did not purchase this for my home . i purchased it for our travel trailer . i am very pleased with it . i do n't anticipate to replace it often , since the trailer is used on a trip maybe once a month . 
hi sharon . no . i 've noticed the corners fold and stick to themselves but my curtain is just a little short in length and just makes it to the top of the tub so it does not stick . i hope this helps . 
it says in the product title `` heavy duty strength with extra bottom magnets ( 6 ) , '' and below that , it says `` accompanied with reinforced metal grommets & extra bottom magnets ( 6 magnets- double the average ! ) , '' and it says in the product description `` extra bottom magnets ( 6 ) . '' 
the curtain is 72 inches or 6 feet . only you can dictate how fair down into the tub it goes by deciding what height you put the curtain rod . the curtain rod should be approx . 76 inches from the bathroom floor . i like my liner . i hope this helps you . 
i did not notice a strong smell , but the vinyl is very stiff and does not slide or fold easily out of the way . it is a very large curtain , very bulky , but it is sturdy , will not tear easily . 
the shower curtain was made in china but distributed by a company in milwaukee . 
we carry many different latex mattress models . we carry models that have latex only , with no other foam types , and we have hybrid mattresses , which consists of latex and poly foam mixed . the roma mattress consists of a 6 '' core of latex , encased in a cover padded with poly-foam for contouring cushion . poly foam offers a different type of feel than latex , which some customers prefer . if you are wanting an all-latex mattress , with no other types of foams , we offer the naturale on amazon . this mattress consists of 7 '' of dunlop latex , encased in a cotton and wool cover . there is no poly-foam in the mattress . 
i just called the company . the mattress has a 20 year warranty . the second 10 years of that 20 year period is prorated at 10 % per year for replacement . over the period of a year he has roughly 30 warranty calls in regards to a mattress derpression out of hundreds sold in that year . 
hello we do not add any flame-retardants to our roma or naturale mattresses . in the roma , we use rayon as a natural fire-barrier . in the naturale , we use the wool as a natural fire-barrier . thank you kindly , have a terrific day ! sleepez 
yes , i 'm using it on a platform bed without a box spring , and it works great ! 
hello and thank you for your question . the organic cotton knit cover is padded with rayon fiber which acts as the natural fire barrier in the roma mattress . please feel free to call our factory showroom directly at 480-966-9282 if you have any other questions . thanks , sleep ez 
100 % natural dunlop latex . 
yes it can as long as it gives good support and does not have large gaps between wood or springs . avoid foundations made from all metal that have large open spaces . although inexpensive this type of foundation reduces the life of your mattress because of improper support . 
the roma mattress is a stand-alone special . it is equipped with 6 '' of dunlop latex , encased in a non-zipper cotton and foam cover . this mattress is not available in any other type of latex or covering . thank you for your inquiry !

it just sits in a little groove but it 's lined with non-slip material . 
not really its purpose , but `` thinking outside the box '' , why not ! it has a stylus pen so you do n't have to touch the screen , just use the pen . the tablet stand adjusts to various angles from 90* to 20* or so . you 'd have to use it on a counter or table flat surface versus your lap . never thought of a use like that , but why not . depends on your puzzle gaming style , i guess . 
they are super easy to clean . i just use hot water and rinse , wipe out . they come clean very easy . 
it is made in china . the silicone is high quality . it has a very good feel and weight . 
i 'm sure you can , it would have to be a small piece of lemon ... .. 
12.5 '' round , and 18 '' high 
mine was just over 17 '' tall and 13 '' diameter 
hi , thanks for your question . according to the product page , the dimensions are 13 '' in diameter x 18 '' in height . for future reference , this information can be found in the `` product description '' section of the product page . i hope this helps ! 
it is ceramic so i do not see why it could not . i would use it outside . 
ours has n't stretched . is made of a nylon , possibly could stretch after heavy usage , but it has a screw that tightens down on the line after you pull it out , so you can adjust the length of line . 
i see no reason why it ca n't be used outdoors . however , be aware that it 's designed to hold only a few light items - i doubt the string would last long if , for example , you put large wet bath towels on it . also , the string might quickly deteriorate from outdoor exposure to uv light , and it 's not at all clear if it can be easily replaced . 
no 
the cord housing is about 3.75 inches in diameter . the small bracket that holds the end of the cord is about 2.5 inches by 1 inch . the cord was not measured . hope this helps ! 
i mounted this a while ago . my recollection is that it screws off or it easily pulls off .

there are three blades total and two of them can fit in the base for storage while the 3rd one is in use ( or in storage ) . so yes , there is a place for all 3 blades for storage

these chairs are really decent for the money . bought them not intending to use them very much , but use them every day . legs are black on both the black leather and the wine colored leather chairs that i have . husband and son are both over 210 pounds -- -- chairs support them great , and are also wide and comfortable in the seat . sturdy enough to stand up to two climbing grandchildren as well . i am 100 percent happy with this purchase . 
it does not have hard wood bottom . this has thick sturdy metal wires , they are very comfortable . i highly recommend these chairs ... i love them .

unfortunately , this item is shipped in a set of two within one box . therefore we will not be able to sell for one instead of two . 
you should calibrate any thermometer but if you are getting weird readings try changing the battery . acurite recommends a basic alkaline not a heavy duty . this worked for mine . 
i just used it in my grill . you have to watch the temp of the grill . the black insulator on the probe dissolved from the heat . the probe is supposed to be good for 750 deg . my grill thermometer read about 500 deg . it could have been hotter . 
yes . directions are in the manual 
i have not tried it yet in wet weather , however i will use it in raining weather ... . 
they have a limited one year warranty . i purchased this the end of july . the very first time i used it the probe went bad . i just threw it in the box figuring it was just another piece of junk . i ran across it last week in the garage so i thought i would give them a call . they had me send them proof of purchase and said they would send me a new probe . it has only been a couple of days so i have n't received it yet . the lady was very nice in customer service . 
no , but not hard to put together-just put legs on and maybe drawer hardware if i remember .

i buy mosa soda cartridges on that big internet auction website that amazon probably wo n't let me mention here . starts with an e -- - ! i buy them in lots of more than 100 cartridges -- gets the cost down to somewhere about 30 cents each . 
it only carbonates one 16 oz bottle . they are small co2 cartridges and when they discharge they are useless . you can buy them super cheap at army surplus stores or outdoor activity stores . they are the same cartridges used in paintball guns and bb guns . 
it takes between 5 and 10 seconds . not that it fluctuates , but it 's my guess . note there is more though . once the gasification is complete you need to shake the bottle assembly to maximize the bubble effect . i usually shake it about 30 times . finally , wait about 30 seconds after the gasification has stopped before unscrewing the cartridge chamber rod assembly . in summary , the entire process requires about 40 seconds from gas release commencement before you can pour the final product . 
the bottle is plastic . 
no idea i went to bbb and picked up the ones they have for the other devices they work just as well . 
yes ! i bought isi soda chargers 
not sure . i cooked a 6lb pork bbq in an hour and a half . dried beans in 45 minutes . i love mine and i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to save time in the kitchen ... . 
yes there are several books on the subject . truly its the best way to prepare meals by keeping the nutrients intact , listen the only thing this cant do is good camilia red beans , this takes cooking in a crock pot or on the stove ; - ) 
yes . same place and various sizes . search `` go wise stainless steel pot . '' 
1300 watts 
yes . i prefer to brown it in a pan first just because it is a bit awkward to reach in the pot . i can brown more at a time in a skillet . i also like to run the fan vent over the stove when browning . 
it has a `` saute '' setting and a higher `` brown '' setting . hope that helps . 
yes and has a self safety release button 
yes . 
120v-60hz and 1000w . 
the deni 9765 electric pressure cooker does not come with a cookbook . 
yes . 
good question . i do not know . somewhere in the information packet or on cooker should be a phone number try calling it . 
no but i got one from amazon n love it and share recipes with my family , , love the camera on my i phone i take pic of recipe n send it to family n friends who have a deni 
*innovative heat , steam and pressure combo makes delicious meals fast *cooks , stews , braises , roasts , simmers , slow-cooks and more *non-stick aluminum cooking pot *self-locking lid prevents opening before food is ready *programmable set-and-forget timer , with up to 8 hr . delay *stay-cool stainless-steel housing *automatic shutoff valve *variable setting cooks , warms , browns , etc . 
i like to help but i gave it as a present . i do n't have the book . 
it 's a non-stick ( teflon ) material . 
the two attachments - the large one is for frothing , the other is for keeping the milk stirred moving . all you need to do is put on the frothing attachment , hit the heat button , and it makes heated , frothed milk . 
500 watts 
no sorry ! i love mine , but i would not use bar stools for it . it 's perfect how it is . maybe making the bottom shelf with more space would be the best thing because a lot of my bottles do n't fit in the bottom shelf . 
shelves are almost a foot . wine glasses hang hover a few in above the shelving . the problem is you can only use wine glasses with the smallest bottom base . i went out to pier one and bought over $ 100 worth of wine glasses only to have to take them back and hunt for glasses with very small bottoms that fit the wine rings . 
15.5 '' x 47.25 '' and it is 42 '' bar height 
it should be fine as long as the bar is on a flat level surface . during the assembly i make see what other measures i could take to increase the stability , such as glue it increased screws . but that would just be as a precaution as it 's pretty sturdy from the start . 
dark brown 
no 
bottom 11 '' , middle 11 1 2 '' , and top 8 '' 
the sheet set i received did n't say . it is n't 100 % cotton . it just says 100 % cotton touch . it 's 100 % microfiber though 
the comforter or sheets ? 
hi , thanks for your question . this set includes : 1 x comforter 90x90 '' , 2 x pillow shams 20x26+2 '' , 1 x bed skirt 60x80+14 '' , 2 x decor pillows 18x18 '' , 1 x breakfast 9x14 '' , 1 x decor pillow 20x20 '' , 1 x flat sheet , 1 x fitted sheet , and 2 x pillow cases . for future reference , this information is located in the product description of the product page . i hope this helps ! 
the jumbo size papers work perfect in these . the bottom is 2 '' . not sure of actual heighth , but i made awesome jumbo muffins for christmas giving . the container showed them so great . know i will reorder sometime in the near future . 
china by a highly reputable company to standards set by the dr. richard 's company for not only the us market but worldwide . 
it is 10-gauge heavy duty peva so it is not recommended to machine wash it . it is , however , quite possible to spray it with any biodegradable cleaning solution as it hangs and just wipe it down . 
72 inches x 71 inches 
unfortunately no . 
three . 
it is not clear . it 's not white either . very thick heavy duty frosty , which is really nice . not wrapping you around with the steam ! stays put in place during the whole shower time ... and i take loooong showers ( 30-40 min ) 
that 's what 's printed on them . and i 've used them in the microwave without apparent harm . 
indonesia 
yes , this set works well both in the dishwasher and microwave . btw -- i 've gotten many compliments on the colors -- they 're beautiful ! 
very pale , greenish blue . ( very ) slightly darker toward the edge of the plates & tops of the bowls & mugs . 
yes , they are made in china . 
it does n't have the sheen of cotton sateen , but the sheets are really soft and silky feeling . 
cr 2032 
no . i use my chefalarm for that purpose . it 's made by the same company . 
although i know what a turduken is , i have never actually cooked one . all i can really tell anyone is that the probe on this thermometer is 2 3 4 '' long . this is a very fast-reading thermometer and i 'm very pleased with both of the ones i purchased . hope this helps you . peg leg , maybe this will be of more help . from the original packing slip : `` thermoworks super-fast mini thermometer . item : rt616 '' the entire length of this particular thermometer is approximately 5 3 4 '' and the actual length of the probe is still 2 3 4 '' unless others are referring to another thermoworks model , i do n't know why there is a difference in the probe length . let me know how things work out . i just want you to have a good `` tur '' -- '' duck '' -- '' en '' , not a bad `` turd '' -- '' uck '' -- '' en '' . good cooking ! ! ! 
not more than 3 seconds 
yes both f and c. it works really good . i am glad i purchased it . 
the temperature range on the super-fast mini is -40 degrees f to 302 degrees f or -40 degrees c to 150 degrees c. that 's according to factory specs , but i had mine read a temperature of up to 380 degrees f . 
no there is no backlight or illumination of the readout . 
yes i think it looks just like it ! 
it 's a little shiny and gold , but not a metallic finish 
i am a international customer , so it would melt . 
only 1 
no . just the bed 
there is no matress , thanks . 
not at all 
if you are referring to a inside door that separates rooms , then i would say `` no . '' if you are referring to a kitchen cabinet door , then i would say `` maybe . '' the inner dimension of the hook is about 5 8 '' . finally , you would not be able to close the door properly even if the hook did go over the door . i hope this response was helpful . 
the hook can easily carry the weight of your skillet . is your bar attached to the wall securely ? you 're more likely to have a problem with the bar pulling away from the wall if you have a lot of weight on it . 
4 1 2 '' long by 1 1 2 '' wide 
looks like about 5 8 '' 
i would n't . too light . they would end up in the punch , i suspect . and they look more industrial than decorative . 
it is a little firm but not too firm . the back cushions are more plush and soft than the bottom cushions so it 's a nice balance . the back cushions are stitched in place so they stay in place . the fabric feels like real suede . it 's a very comfortable couch . 
22 1 2 inches from the the bottom of the back cushions to the front of the seat cushions . 
yes 
thank you for your interests on our product ! we have this model in blue and red , but not brown . here is the link for the red one for your reference . http : www.amazon.com gp product b00gwscrtq have a nice day ! 
thank you for your interest in our product . all shipping is free and curbside delivery , please refer to the storefront policy for more information about white glove availability . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
the short answer is yes they are egyptian cotton . they are bright white , but have a bit of a texture to them almost like linen , and they are a very decent weight . for a larger napkin which is heavier and has no texture check out the satin band napkins by typing b00cen2nbu into the search box . i get asked all the time what is egyptian cotton , so here is the technical answer : egyptian cotton is `` extra long staple '' mostly made from a cotton plant called gossypium barbadense . these plants are , in fact , grown all over the world including in the us , china and india . egyptian cotton does not necessarily mean that the cotton was grown in egypt . if the cotton is actually from egypt it is called giza cotton . the fiber length is around 1 3 8 inches which is extra long and does make for a softer more luxurious product . 
i try to keep these napkins at a good price year around so i do n't often discount them . i do , however , try to offer discounts for larger purchases , so i create a promo code for you ( and anyone else reading this ) . at check out , type in tendozen and we you receive 10 % any order of 10 dozen or more napkins . i hope this helps . thank you for considering these . russell 
yes perfect for monogram 
these will ship within a day of the order . if i am fulfilling them , they will come from virginia so they will be delivered in 1-5 days . if amazon is fulfilling them ( which will be the case soon ) , they will get there in 2 days if you have prime . - russell 
yes , it does . readable at day and night . 
yes , it is a long rectangular box about the size of the fork . should be easy to wrap . 
this can easily be used on hamburgers.i 've even used it on chicken wings , and it worked just great 
no 
yes , definitely remove the plastic . 
compartment on the back , lid will slid off , to acess the battery . 
yes it will display the range of doneness , once you set meat selection before inserting ... good device ! 
i believe they are the same pillows . the picture of the brochure in the cpapfit cpap pillow shows `` by pur-sleep , '' and the order receipt included with my pillow showed the same manufacturer , `` pur-sleep . '' in addition , both pillows appear identical in the pictures with the same 10 year warranty and patents pending . i could not find any conflicting information , though some information could not be matched ( such as upc or dimensions ) due to omission of that information from one of the pillows . while the price is the same for either pillow , i had a positive experience with the vendor `` form-fit pillow , '' plus the one listed here has almost three times the amount of reviews . hope this helps ! 
i 'd try the seller . 
it fits in an ordinary pillow case . the shape is `` moldable '' so you can push the hulls around to make it a more normal pillow shape when making the bed , for example . 
yes , the pillow now ships with foam , pre-blended with the hulls . 
yes it does ! : ) 
19x14x4 
yes it does 
kurt , the mattress has a quilted cover on both sides . one side is quilted a little plusher and the other has a firmer quilt . this is how you are able to get 12 different combinations . you can get 6 different combos per quilted side . please let me know if you have any other questions . 
yes , definitely ! there is no spring inside , so it will bend following the adjustable bed . i have it in my trailer , underneath the bed there is storage , when i lift the lid of the bed , the mattress also bend following the curve of the platform . 
each of the 3 layers were a little over 2.0 lbs ft3 . the foam itself appeared to be a high density well made foam . 
ive had this for about two years and it still glows.. the thing is that i lived in a basement room with no windows ( which may be why they glow so bright ) and all it needs is light from any light bulb to make it glow . ill turn on the lights from my room and then when im ready for bed ill turn off the lights and it feels like im floating in a bunch of stars . now i gave the bedroom to my nephews and they love it . i still have some leftover stars and theyre still glowing . now i have a room with two windows and i have blackout curtains to go with them and the stars still shine bright . ill never regret buying this product . i love it . 
probably . they are so awesome . 
hi lepilleur , this picture is made up of many set of small decals . offer some details for you reference : c:328*3.4*3.4cm . show : desigh type : c ; decal size : 3.4*3.4cm . quantity : 328pcs 
yes , very fine serrations . quality is exceptionally good in my opinion with a beautiful high polish on the steak knives in particular . only draw back about this set is you have to buy the 3 big knives separately ( block has empty slots for them ) and they run $ 146 for the 3 total , but it 's a heirloom quality set so i just ordered one at a time when i could so it did n't seem like so much money at once . the 3 additional knives that are ordered as open stock to fill the 3 empty slots are : classic boning $ 42 , classic 7-inch santoku with hollow edge $ 57 , classic 7-inch bread knife $ 47 . bob b . 
yes it does have a block with it ! 
yes , they are all in the classic series . i 'm very pleased with them . 
yes , 3 extra slots . 
i have not had any issues with mine rusting at all . 
the dc65 weighs 19 pounds . 
no . this is 110v . 
i 'm not sure , however this version came with everything you would probably need . we did n't even bother considering keeping any of the attachments from our old dyson . 
it has an upholstery brush attachment , but i do think the suction would be too strong for draperies . hope this helps . 
no . 
the color and the animal comes with two additional attachments : a dyson tangle free turbine and a dyson soft dusting brush . http : www.amazon.com dyson-tangle-free-tool-turbine dp b008sh85j0 http : www.amazon.com dyson-49-soft-dusting-brush dp b000anhpiw 
it shouldnt ( we dont have laminate floors ) ; you can shut of the beater bar when on floors other than carpet 
already there 
the default beep mode is on . press start once . press timer clock once . press start once . press timer clock once and that should turn off the beep . check page 14 of the manual or this link . http : www.manualslib.com manual 550707 panasonic-nnsn773s.html ? page=14 # manual 
the top and sides are stainless colored , but not actually stainless steel . they look more like the platinum ( non-fingerprinting ) metal that they put on some fridges . it looks really sharp . 
in traditional microwave ovens , cooking power is controlled by cycling energy to an internal device called a magnetron . magnetrons can only deliver a full burst of energy , so when you set your microwave to low , the magnetron is turned off part of the time and on part of the time . inverter microwaves allow for fine-tuned control of the heat for a constant steady cooking temperature , and this helps them work more effectively . read more : http : www.ehow.com facts_6818200_inverter-microwave_.html 
it does have a countdown timer function . 
yes , pretty much . you can press 4:00 and `` start '' and it will run for four minutes on full power . the best feature of this oven is the `` inverter '' technology , however , which lets you set a power level , 1-10 , and actually delivers that level of microwave power , as opposed to a normal microwave that , say , on power level 5 runs on full power for 10 seconds , then no power for 10 seconds . it really makes a difference . 
it is a very quiet one . heats very well and even . 
i just had a similar panasonic model which i bought from amazon also . it was large like this one , and it was 1200 watts . mine lasted for 4 years and 4 months . thoroughly loved the way it worked ! also owned a panasonic before that one , although i do n't remember how long it lasted . 
about 23 inches . 
they are 2 '' hope this helps . 
i 'm assuming you mean like a rolling rack ? if so , absolutely could . 
yes 
if you can hang a regular hanger on your rod , you will be fine with this product . it measures 1.5 '' ( as a regular hanger ) 
vertical bars are approx 3 4 '' in diameter . same for the one horizontal bar . 
i think it 's about 6 '' to 6.5 '' . they are fantastic knives ! 
they are fully ceramic - my husband loves these knives ! 
republic of china 
no 
yes a wonderful product 
i do n't know what manufacture recommends but i have washed mine in dishwasher with no negative effects to the knives regardless of size washed 
this listing is for the table only 
no , i did it by myself and usually i 'm not good in assembling furnitures . maybe it takes a bit longer but it 's not impossible . 
not super far . we have a small room that it 's in and i do n't feel like it sticks out or looks awkward . 
i thought this would be an issue for me but i honestly have n't even thought abt having an ottoman since ive been using the chair . it 's pretty easy and comfortable to rock and glide without one . 
all the way up 
yes . this chair has a rocking motion , not gliding . so it swivels , rocks , and reclines . 
it does recline pretty far back . i think it would be comfortable to sleep in if you really wanted to . 
not really and i live in az i know heat . lol . 
we recommend you do not use either electric blankets or heating pads with our memory foam toppers . the memory foam material responds to your body temperature , and the additional heat from electric blankets or heating pads causes the mattress to respond to that heat instead of conforming to your body . longer periods of exposure to the heat from electric blankets or heating pads may damage the memory foam material . 
this topper arrived tightly compressed and rolled double-folded in a box about 30 '' x24 '' x18 '' ( i 'm guesstimating here from my recollection ) . the package weighed about 20-25 lbs . easy for one person to handle . 
yes ! ! of course ! but just in casa and to avoid it to get off easy , you could buy `` sheet suspenders '' . i have it on every bed in my house . 
it is unlikely a normally-operating electric blanket will melt this topper , as the foam reflects traps enough heat that the temperature control will kick in as if a person were under the blanket . i would not recommend an electric blanket , however , as the viscose foam sleeps very warm . you will find that more than your own body heat ( except in unusually cold conditions ) may be warmer than you prefer . 
yes ; the flexibility of the foam and the fact that it is only 2.5 '' thick make it appropriate for folding into a sofa bed . i would not recommend that it be the only mattress on the bed , however . 
no cover came with this product . i wish it did ! ! 
i would say yes but if you had s good sheet set with form fitting bottom sheet it might be enough . 
yes , it will accommodate a standard twin mattress ( 39 '' x 75 '' ) , less than 8 '' thick for safety . 
it 's 4 boxes on 1 pallet . 
the distance between the rungs is 10 '' . 
no , it only goes together as pictured , with the desk to the left and ladder to the right . 
it is pine wood with mdf for strength on the tops of the casegoods ( chest , bookcase and desk ) . 
the desk measures 29 '' long , when extended . 
it 's mostly hardwood , but there is some mdf used on the tops and sides of the chest and desk .

hi there ! thanks for the question - this mat is just shy of 3 4 '' thick . i hope that helps and thank you very much for checking us out ! ! 
36 '' x 20 '' i use it in front of the sink , but have a movable island and it gets used when i move the island to the sink in an `` l '' shape and it is a `` two-fer '' . 
like other people have posted , my unit arrived with no bonus packs even though the packaging clearly states bonus there are bonus packs inside . i do n't know if it is an innocent oversight or more malicious involvement . 
keurig recently changed the cup holder to have larger ridges inside . this prevents it from using re-usable k-cups . irritating as hell . from what i can tell , it started with the october build dates . 
chris , it can comfortably hold a 7 incher ... 
13 '' high , 10 '' wide , 12 '' deep 
well , i 'm not the strongest person around , and i think it works easily . if the clove is very large it takes more strength to squeeze it than if the clove is small . you could always cut the clove in half to make it even easier . 
what a good question ! i looked closer at the handles and they appear to be sealed . i have never had water get trapped in them . however , i have never left them submerged in a sink of water either . they are so easy to clean , that just a quick swish under the faucet has always been enough . i have not put them through a dish washer either . they are so easy to rinse clean , that it just seems like an unneccesary waste of space to put them in there . 
ehm ... yes . there are no sharp edges . 
i have the kuhn and the problem i have with it is that i have pinched my hand several times . i am now more careful in how i use is it , so i have n't the problem in awhile . however , it is the only garlic press i have ever owned that caused me to get pinched . i bought it because it was stainless and had good reviews . other than the pinched skin it has been a good choice . 
yes it does work on ginger . just put a piece in , squeeze , and voila . i eat more garlic and ginger because of this crusher and that makes me happy : ) 
it is 9 '' tall to the top of the pump . 
recommend hand washing . learned the hard way that anything with a gummy label will gum up the food grinder assembly in your dishwasher causing it to malfunction . expensive problem to fix . 
it really depends on the type of liquid you place in the pump . thinner liquids will dispense slightly more than thicker . 
not sure if bottles come in actual colors , these are clear and can change color with whatever liquid you add inside . 
the threaded neck of the bottle measures 1-5 64 '' outside diameter ( including the threads ) , or just over 27 mm . the inside diameter of the pump top would be the same measurement . good luck ! 
it 's 19 '' w , 11 '' tall and 14 '' deep . 
okay . i just looked in the little instruction booklet that came with the microwave . and i could not find anything mentioned there about turning the sounds off . so if there is a way to do this.. i do n't know how one would do it . so i guess no , probably not . sorry . 
yes , when you press the area to release ( open ) the door , the light does indeed come on . then when you close the door the light goes off . and then when you set the cooking time and start the mircowave the light comes on again and it stays on while cooking the food . hope that helped . ( if you have any further questions , just ask.. i will help if i can . ) 
no , it is made in china . we purchased one this year , and that 's what it says on the back . 
no , but you do n't need to . since the table is turned by a spinning `` gear '' that meshes with a matching outcrop on the bottom of the platter , all that you need to do is turn the platter upside down . that way the gear will spin without turning the platter . 
120v-60hz -- input 1350w output 900w 
you know i 'm not sure but they are not terribly sturdy , altho i love them ... i 've had them drop and crack so as not to be usable..bummer.. so it 's not likely an item that will last a long , long time . 
they work very well . just do n't overfill , because the contents do expand in the freezer . 
the container is about 6 '' tall , top diameter is 4.5 '' and bottom is 3.5 '' in diameter . capacityy is 1 quart . 
it is on the package . 
thanks for your question , yes , this listing is for a pack of 2 rolls at 25 feet each . i hope this helps ! 
clear 
yes 
no adhesive . i have just moved into a new house and have lined every cabinet and closet shelf with it . just takes time to measure and cut . i find it easier using a straight edge and mat knife 
i received two rolls and each roll was 25 feet long . 
made in taiwan 
no , nothing but water and they dont even like water with heavy minerals 
no 
yes 
yes it is wood . it 's a heavy table , but it 's been great for card games . 
the size is 32 inches square and 29 inches tall 
no , it 's a very sturdy , well-made table . 
yes , it would be the perfect dining table for two people . 
to be honest the legs did not look flared to me at all until i saw your question , so i hope i can explain this . the legs are each at 45 degree angles to their respective corners , and are made of solid 1 '' x2 '' wood . the narrow sides ( 1 '' ) are completely vertical . the 2 '' side is slightly flared out toward the corner by about 1 '' , or about a half-bubble on a level . make sense ? 
i have not seen it in that size . but this one is wonderful and is a perfect card table . elegant and beautiful - it 's a wonderful piece of furniture that will compliment any room . do n't hesitate on this . 
i have not tested weight capacity but much studier than the old style card tables . very stable and have used for card playing and as a temporary fly tying bench . 
the product is designed in the us and made in china . 
i do n't think so , prestiage pressure cookers are made of aluminum . you could give it a magnet test , some aluminum cookware have iron plates formed in the bottoms . 
really , how do you expect the device to `` know '' you forgot about what you were doing with it ? 
i ma satisfied 
the color of the cover is white . 
yes the cover is white , as indicated in the below pictures on the website , and the material is also mulberry silk . 
yes it can be dry cleaned . please note that the deluxe all-silk comforter is very high-end product and it requires careful handling . you can use dry clean but with low or warm temperature only to maintain the smoothness of the silk surface and the softness of the inside silk filling . 
2.75 '' 
you take out the stopper & lay this over the bath tub drain opening . i have one for all my tubs & they all fit snugly over the drain . there is a model that fits over the stopper . that model has suction cups to secure it . i 've purchased that model & prefer this one . it 's easy to clean & is rust free . 
yes it should as long as the drain size is correct 
the dimensions are listed as 2.8 inches . that means it is just over 2-3 4 '' . so the answer would be no . 
it 's very slightly convex ( curved up in the center ) . 
i have noticed that it does go from blue to red ; however it eventually goes back to blue . i believe the sensor as it senses more pollutants in the air when it goes red . 
yes . it has an on off switch on the back and touch screen on the front for levels .

by rebooting , do you mean reset the filter after you change it ? turn machine on , press `` filter '' icon ( of whichever filter you changed ) until it beeps 3 seconds . select filter icon of the one you changed till it 's lit up . press and hold 3 to 5 seconds . the filter is reset . 
made in china 
good morning , this does n't get rid of smells , just rids the air of mold spores and allergens . 
sorry , i really do n't know . 
sure . we will need your exact address if you would like a shipping cost estimate . thank you ! 
yes it is . it is somewhat heavy but i do n't have hand strength and i can use it easily . it is so much better than any other one i have used . put unpeeled clove in , close and out the garlic comes ... open , peel out the peel and continue on . i highly recommend it . 
one does not have to peel the garlic . just put it into the compartment , vigorously squeeze , and scrape out the crushed peel . 
it 's made in china , `` exclusively for orblue '' as stated on the box . 
it is 8 '' long and 3 '' wide at its widest point . 
i do n't know the exact dimensions without getting it out to measure , but it 's about 1-1 2 '' by 3 4 '' and close to an inch deep on the deepest end . good sized for most home kitchens . 
very easy to clean . 
better than the frigidaire at 50f about the same at 70f 
made in china by a canadian usa company . 
yes , i do n't see why not . however i just gravity drain with mine . 
hi beverly , the recall is only for the units made for the canada market . this is a copy of the information i received from my distributor and danby . on september 12th a voluntary recall of dehumidifiers built by gree electric appliances inc. of zhuhai , china was announced by the consumer product safety commission . of the 2.2 million units affected by this recall , a single danby model of less than a 1000 units was included . this model was sold to a single us retailer but had not been placed on the retail floor . since that time all inventory has been accounted for , quarantined and is in the process of being returned to danby products inc. affected models : danby model brand upc ddr4511 danby 67638 90285 4 danby usa does not actively source and sell dehumidifiers from gree for the united states market . gree manufactured dehumidifiers are sold through our canadian division . to clarify , none of the dehumidifier products we sell into the united states market are supplied by gree . therefore none of our united states distributors , retailers , or consumers will be impacted by this recall . consumers should not be concerned about danby branded dehumidifiers they purchased from retailers in the united states . this recall does not affect them . '' please let me know if i can help you with any other concerns . sandy wray , owner best kitchen products

i have confirmed one difference , the rated water collection in 24 hours is 60 pints in the ddr60a3gp and 70 in this ddr70a2gp . also , there are several reviewer comments and question responses that state that this ddr70 does shut off the fan as well as the compressor in contrast to the c.r . unfavorable comments about the continuous run of the ddr60 . 
it 's a regular garden hose connection like i 've always found on houses . it 's plastic but connected solidly to my hose and has n't leaked . 
jorge `` steamed heat '' panni was one of the greatest luchadores on the traveling circuit in the early 1920s . his trademarked move , `` the panni press , '' never failed to fall an opponent . panni would swiftly maneuver to gain position on his rivals . once their backs were to him , he would line his body against theirs ; clutching them very closely . then , using his great strength , superior flexibility and overwhelming size , he would begin to bend his body ; essentially folding his opponent in half at the waist , leaving them breathless , dazed , covered in sweat and embarrassed . once they were incapacitated , panni would `` garnish '' his rivals , finishing them off with a move he called `` the pickle spear ; '' much to the delight of the crowd . 
i have been using it for sandwiches and even warming up tortillas . it heats up pretty fast , but does n't get dangerously hot on the outside..then it cools down pretty quick ... it has never taken 40 mins to cool ... maybe around 10 15 mins at most . it gets kind of hot on the outside like a wafflemaker would- if you have one , then you can judge for yourself . 
this unit is 1200 watts . 
they do not - it is an `` all in one piece '' unit . it does clean up very easily and we would have liked one where the plates came out , but the ceramic was more important to us as we did n't want the teflon coating in others . 
not that i 've seen anywhere , and it seems i looked everywhere before buying this one . 
no , the grates are not removable . 
i would say yes . we have made paninis and cooked meats of varying thicknesses and the top of the press can `` adjust '' to appropriately `` sandwich '' whatever we are cooking . 
2 or 3 , but it 's not that strong . we use it for storage and decoration . i would n't recommend it for permanent sitting on it . 
16.5 '' high with legs attached 
it is made of faux leather , very soft to the touch . i love it , i use it often to sit on it with my laptop desk . very confy ! 
yes 
the dimension must be listed on the sale page ; it 's a great item ... 
if you get from indian mixer grinder store they you do not need to buy square trade warranty , it comes with 3 year warranty . but if you like to buy from square trade warranty , it is your all . 
it will do but not that good . 
yes working nice in us 
yes 
i got this mixer recently and it is really good . i use it twice a week to grind rice and dhal , it runs smooth with no issues . 
i have a glass top range ( normal electric ) and they work great . 
yes rachel , they can . what i do is light the burner and then turn it down some before placing the pot on the burner ; i 'm not sure whether that 's really necessary or not but i do it to keep the flame from discoloring the outside of the pan pot . i am assuming that your stove is the same as mine , i.e . you have to turn it to high for it to light . i actually bought this set for a rental unit but i would not hesitate to buy them for myself-they are very nice . hope this helped . 
no 
no , same color as the pans and they say tfal 
us 
yes 
that information is available on a link on the page - its something like more information- or details just look around , you will find it 
various sizes but i thought that was given when you click on details . anyhow . i have not found a need for any pots of different sizes than what was included . 
no . they are not safe for induction cooking . you would need to get stainless steel or copper . 
no- shams are black . but backside is white - lighter material that is obviously back side , so not really reversible 
18 inches 
yes . the people saying that it does n't have a carousel ( turntable ) , and that it does n't turn are incorrect . it does have a rotating carousel that works perfectly . i am not happy about the stupid clock though.i did n't notice the international time on the description , and as a result it was an unpleasant surprise . other than that , it 's a cute little microwave that works well . 
does have a glass plate but does not turn inside . 
on a 3.2oz bag of pop secret hit the power button and turn the timer on to 1:40 seconds . if there is a popcorn setting i have not used it . we like ours not overcooked and listen to the kernels popping . this is the time that makes it just exactly perfect . have not tried baked potatoes yet . 
it 's a push button start . if it 's not starting you may have a defect . it 's worked really well for us . 
i have no idea . this question you should ask to the producer nostalgia electrics . they certain have an reasonable answer for you ! 
lowest position is approx . 23 '' from floor . highest is approx . 31 '' . 
no , they are very easy 
i do n't even know , these stools are going to charity now as they were terrible quality and i was not happy with them at all . the plastic ring on the bottom to avoid floor scratches lasted about 2 weeks , the chairs started tipping forward as well as other things i was not happy with . good advice , save your money because when you see them if you want to send them back , the return shipping costs almost as much as the stools . 
i 'm sorry i do not know . i had ordered brown . i do not recall having a problem with color verification . sorry i could not be more help . 
yes i believe there was an allen wrench . however assembly was super easy and no real tools were required . 
not sure , but probably about 10 lb . each ? 
the instructions for mine were in each box ( i ordered 4 ) . in one box , it was at the very bottom if the box . it 's one sheet of paper , so look thru everything . 
seat of the stools are 171 2 inches wide 14 inches deep ( front to back ) . backs of the stools are 171 2 inches wide and 13 inches top to bottom . 
i weigh 200 lbs and they do ok for me but i do n't think they could handle very much more than that.hope this helps 
46 inches . 
here 's a blurb from the owner 's manual . `` construction is moisture-resistant but we do not recommend full immersion of the cable . '' 
i dont think so . it works perfectly with the chefalarm though . 
yes 
the high temp pro series probe is six inches long after the bend . 
yes 
yes . perfectly 
china 
it is a plug in and it is actually magnetic for safety purposes ! i absolutely loved it and used it as a party with several children around . 
no , this is electric 
it 's electric . 
no 
a standard quart plastic tub of store bought yogurt fits in ... however , the jar provided with the yogurt maker is much better plastic to use than the regular quart plastic jar of store bought yogurt . 
there is a built in prong in the unit , just remove the paper sticker , leaving the plastic cap , then put the bottle into the unit . you will hear a pop as the prong punctures the cap . 
please make sure the hot water switch on the back of the unit is on . the lights will be on when unit is either heating or cooling the water inside the tanks . once the water reaches the appropriate temperature , lights will go off . 
no.. 
absolutely . in back there is a switch for exactly that purpose . so you can have cold and hot , or cold and room temp . 
5 feet 
the comforter has indeed some thickness to them , but not big , they are designed to be a light weight with medium warmth . 
it sure is ... .it 's great ! ! 
mine is a king size and the squares are 9 and 3 4 by 9 and 3 4. also , there are tabs on the 4 corners for a duvet cover . 
no . it was made in china 
fluffy is a relative term . even after washing it is not flat like a sheet but it is not two or three inches thick either but it has body . we like it and our heating system is set at 68 degrees for the cold nights we get in southwest florida . 
i brown meat all the time . i put in a tablespoon of olive oil and turn the timer to 15 minutes so it gets nice and hot ... leave the lid off . it browns beautiful in a few minutes on each side . i take the meat out and pour in my liquid ( stock , water , wine or beer ) just a 1 4 cup and scrape up the good brown bits then put the meat back in with vegetables , rice , etc. , and set the timer . dinner is ready in a few minutes . 
less than 10 pounds . it looks heavier than it is , and if you get one , & it 's your first one , you might consider one of his other ones with per-programed settings . then advance as you get use to pressure cooking . try stew meat & fresh vegetables , add one can of beef broth & you 'll have a meal of tender beef in less than 35 minutes . 
1200 watts 
teflon 
yes 
when you first plug it in it defaults to the warm setting , it starts the cooking cycle when you set the timer . 
this one is n't made for canning . 
it is the same color as the comforter gray . 
we do not offer the comforter individually . thank you 
yes , please use link 
hello there - if you select us as the seller mmp living and add the item to your cart you 'll be able to see if this can be shipped to the uk . hope that helps . mike 
we offer both standard and expedited shipping options to taiwan . thank you 
standard shipping to uk for the item is $ 34.99 and expedited is $ 87.99 . you can find are shipping tables at the following link 
yes , we will ship this item internationally . thank you 
no cartridge . i believe the only 'user-serviceable ' parts are the plates and the uv bulb . by the looks of it , it should n't be difficult at all to replace . i will also say that the customer service this company offers is great . 
5 years ... 
yes you can see the blueish light when it turns on . 
stephanie , your question ca n't be nailed down to exact science . the amount of cigarette smoke can go from a trace on a surface from a week of smoking to a tar build up . i have been using one of these at home for my cars , a camper , and in my basement . at work i 've done design work for ozone rooms to remove smoke smell out of furniture that has been in fires . yes an ozone generator can clean cigarette smoke . if it is smoke damage from years and years of build up , i 'm afraid you are on cleaning duty with brushes and cleaners until you get the tar removed . this baby will do a fine job after that . ~steve davis 
great question . the manual will go over this in detail but most people will wait an hour before entering the room . it 's always a good idea to open any windows and doors to let the room air out after using the purifier . thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
yes just make sure the air is cut on most smells are trapped inside the vents 
the crock is certainly lead and cadmium free . the glaze is applied to both the exterior and interior of the crock . 
no , it does n't . 
74 inches x 60 inches x 3 inches 
i have n't tried the gel , but i like to be warm at night so that does n't bother me . this topper is extremely comfortable , that 's the main thing . 
we never tried latex , so have no response . we like the memory foam a lot ! 
i use a soapy wet rag and then rinse the rag and make sure i get any suds left off . works well 
not sure what a sport blended bottle is , but if it is like an average protein shaker cup it will fit fine . the side bag area is quite large 
yes . click the link above and scroll down to the bpa section of the article . 
just under 1 tablespoon . each one holds 14ml 
i could have my friend in japan read the packaging for me , but i 'd guess that depends on how hot your cycles go and if you could get the little lids to prop open right in your utensil basket . it says they withstand temperatures from -4f to 158f ( -20c to 70c ) . i did n't worry about it since i just washed them out when i got home . 
i 've used this in my daughter 's lunch box with ranch dressing and have n't had them leak . 
i have the vue , and yes it fits . ( do n't forget that the bottom drain part is removable on the vue for taller cups ! ) 
i have the 20 ounce , it does not fit under my breville keurig brewer without the drip tray , i have to tilt it to fill it with coffee . i imagine the height is the same as the elite keurig . 
yes . it is not dishwasher safe , and handwashing is easily done . 
1000 watt 
29 7 8 x 15 9 16 x 15 x 5 8 
vents out the top or the back . it can be changed fairly easy . 
the exhaust can be configured to the existing exhaust if there is one . it can also be configured without an exhaust . easy to convert . 
yes 
mine is metal . 
it has to be leaned against the wall . we used it in our guest room and it is perfect for a few books , odds n ends and some towels . if you are using in an office for a ton of books i would look for something else . 
it 's made of wood . i really love it ! 
i 'm really not sure how much , but mine is loaded up with books , ceramics , and even a vintage typewriter with no problems . 
hello . because the book case is slanted the part thats not flat may not matter . if it does n't work , amazon has a excellent return policy . good luck 
the shelf is just under 72 '' . 
the temperature on the outside is ok. you can make hot tea and then transport it easily . for me is perfect . simple , nice and very usefull 
no . liquids leak out just like any tumbler when tipped . 
ask the manufacturer 
no . darth vader is on the other side . 
i gave this as a gift , i am not sure 280-300 
it fits a regular size twin but still roomy . 
i would n't even try to microwave it . the honey in mine crystallized and when i tried to pull open the lid it broke . that is how delicate the pot is . it is blown glass and very breakable . 
made in china . 
85 watts ; it works beautifully . you ca n't go wrong . i use it just about every day . 
yes 
probably , but no way to be certain . 
yes 
i do n't think so , pomegranate might be too hard for the juicer 
yes , in the `` up '' position , the opening is sealed , and there should be no drips . 
hello andy ! this juicer will be great for juicing citrus such as oranges , lemons , limes , grapefruits , etc . this unit uses a reamer to juice . 
plastic 
i think they would be fine , with stabilizer of course . they are n't textured so the embroidery will be even . 
after being washed and hung to dry mine are 15 '' x24 '' . 
after i washed them they measured 13.5 '' x 22 '' 
these would make great large napkins . love these dishcloths and plan to purchase more . 
sorry william , but we have never run a promotion like the one you are referring to . we did have a 50 % off promotion when this product was launched back in august , but that was only for the first week . ... doug keeble outlets 
we only have the blue stripe towels at this time . however these stripes are near the outer edges of the towels if that helps . ... doug keeble outlets 
no 
most importantly , in addition to the other answers provided ( larger feed tube , different handle design , slightly different look ) , the 8006 is made in s korea and the 8008 is made in china . s korea is best known for its superior manufacturing of the motors for juicers . both have the same warranty from omega so this should not matter , but it is a difference . 
there are quite a few , including plates for pasta extrusion and peanut butter . the basic accessories include the juice collection cup and the pulp collection cup , a cleaning brush , and a `` pusher '' for pushing the cut vegetables down the chute . i ca n't remember them all . for full information , i suggest that you either go to omega 's website or check out this great specialty retailer site http : www.discountjuicers.com . they have not only product information but also videos showing you how to use the product . 
i have the 8008 and i love it i use it for both whetgrass and juicing . it is very easy to clean i think the 8007 and 8008 mods are very similar because they use the same parts 
finish is stainless steel . masticating parts are heavy duty plastic - there are no blades . all high quaity materials . harder items such as carrots cantelope kale & grasses extract best they extract with little to no pulp residual in juice . 
yes , i love my omega , it juices everything 
120 v 200w and it runs off a 15 amp breaker effortlessly . best juicer i have ever used or seen . i love it 
with the assumption that you are asking how easy it is to remove the final product from the magical butter 2 unit ... .. butter would be the only thing that you would want to remove before it cooled enough became solid again . oils and tinctures would obviously pour out of the unit at room temperature . butter on the other hand would begin to solidify as it cooled . you could either use a spatula to remove the butter from the unit if it has cooled to a semi-solid state , or you could simply begin the timed butter making process again in the machine for a brief period , until the unit heated the butter to a liquid state again ( approximately 5 minutes of run time ) . you could then just pour the liquid butter from the unit . ~outlaw~ 
thanks for your question . i 'm sorry to hear your magical butter 2 was n't in perfect condition when you received it . you can return it or request a replacement at our online returns center here : 
no odor at all . other than the lights and the grinding phase , you never know its there . 
approx 24x36 '' 
i am sorry but no . thank you 
24x36 inches 
yes , it is . i put mine in a nice 24x36 frame i got from michael 's . the paper is very lightweight , so if you do n't want it to wrinkle , after you frame it , you should mount it on a foam board . but seriously , for this low of a price , the poster is definitely worth it even if you do n't mount it before framing . 
no it does not . you can have the sanitize function on or off and the filter rate is manually controlled up to level 5 
no i have not found that to be true 
hi mr ritchie just for this limited time the new clouds are in and the ( cloud ) does not have any ozone . but the summit that i am selling as a ( cloud can have ozone if you chose at anytime ) . the ozone plate comes with the ( summit ) does not come with the ( cloud ) but can be bought any time for 25.00 plus shipping.ozone plate produces ozone and is a purifier kills bactria in the air and on surfaces . any questions i have not answered call me lou lombardi toll free 800-868-5534 thanks . 
the cloud works ok with most odors . but when it comes to pet odors the only purifier that will work for pet odors would be the summit . the reason is that unit has ozone and ozone will break down the urine odor and penetrate in to carpet and soft materials . but if there is a lot of urine in the carpet and pad you will need to have the carpet steam cleaned to remove a lot of the urine . there will be some in the pad but the purifier put in the room with the worst odor will keep the odor from migrating in to other spaces . need more personal guidance call me lou lombardi toll free 800-868-5534 . 
yes 
you have to set the timer each time that you use it . 
you can set 3 separate times on the timer . each timer is separate , so you can have one going off in 10 min then another going off in 1 min the another going off in 15 minutes . great timer for multiple dishes . hope this helps . sally 
the description says `` two lr44 batteries '' . amazon carries several options ( of course ) , but here 's one that looks pretty good : http : www.amazon.com pack-maxell-ag13-button-battery dp b001fdojcq ref=sr_1_2 ? s=electronics & ie=utf8 & qid=1405996899 & sr=1-2 & keywords=lr44+batteries 
eventually , i think it shuts off after a minute of beeping . 
yes you can by taking advantage of the fact that the device actually has 4 individual timers . you would set timer 1 at 4 hours , timer 2 at 8 hours , and timer 3 at 12 hours . 
nope . i just took it out and pressed a bunch of buttons and it does n't glow light up ... why are you cooking in the dark.. 
yes the cushions are removable . 
we bought one last year and it came with the small pillows ! ! ! 
no , the lass is not a sofa bed . 
it is my understanding that sofab has moved from the spring loaded cushions and moved to a solid foam core with zipped sofa fiber wrap . this style does have a zipper . 
no . it is plastic . 
i handwash mine . i do n't believe they are dishwasher safe . 
i believe it 's made by a company by the name of gfg . 
i have no idea . 
i do n't see why not . however , it might develop soft spots rather quickly . i have had one for about a year and it is noticeably softer where i sleep compared to the middle . 
it 's a queen size and it measures 78 '' x 58 '' . i love it . hope this helps . 
it 's longer . 
yes 
china . 
my husband is 260 and works great . 
yes 
we bought the mattress pad for our guest futon which was only in use over xmas . as i recall the connector was near the top edge of the mattress but not intruding on the top surface . hope this is of use . p.s . the guests did n't complain ! 
yes , it is shaped like a fitted sheet , and it stays on real well ! 
i ordered a queen and it has dual controls . i ordered this brand specifically for that reason . i really only use one side cause it heats so well and i like to lay in the middle of my bed to have a half warm and half cool side . i 'm cold one minute and hot the next ! haha i 'm not sure about the full size pads ? i did n't look into that . 
machine wash cool water ... on delicate . hang to dry . i put mine in dryer on med for 10 minutes then hang.. do not hand over a line so wires are not bent . i spread mine over rails on my deck . 
no box spring needed . i bought one and the bed fit perfectly . the box spring might make the mattress to high 
it 's wood but cheaply make 
do n't buy this bed read the reviews . trust me ! it a piece of cr & # 128512 ; p 
no , no mattress . 
no , the headboard is not detachable . 
i would think so , though the mattress ontop would be quite high up 
hello.. here are all of the electrical specs provided by the manufacturer of this unit electrical volts : 115 volts amps ( cool ) : 4.8 amps watts ( cool ) : 515 watts length of power cord ( min . max . ) : 6 ft. 6.5 ft. plug type ( nema ) : lcdi ( 5-15p ) we hope this helps 
for extra protection the support bar is good but it is not required for install . some buildings however require you to have it so it 's always good to check 
the height may be an issue . you can purchase plexi glass to fill the top space 
yes . manufacturer 1 year parts and labor and 5 years on compressor 
yes.. this unit can be plugged into a standard socket . we do suggest , however that no other appliance is plugged into the same circuit to avoid overload 
energy efficiency ratio is 9.7 
3 feet . you can do a search for heavy duty extension cord on amazon 
hello , if you want to customize the pillowcase , you can send the picture you like to me in the email , then we will customized for you . thank you . 
dear friend . this pillowcase size is 20 '' x30 '' 
hello , all our pilow case are made of 50 % cotton , 50 % polyester . thank you . 
i thnk you could as the memory foam is very comfortable but i would n't recommend it since it 's only 6 inches . 
it 's a twin . i bought one for my daughter at christmas . it 's large enough for one adult to fit comfortably . two snuggly . and it 's extremely soft , requiring no box spring . hope that helps . 
mattress 
ok & # 65281 ; lt is very good & # 65281 ; 
yes 
it comes in an average sized box it will deffinatley fit in your car when u get home u take it out and unroll it and let it expand 
i used these for all my newborn infants sizes , my baby is now in 9 months sizes and these still work great . also am using them for my 2 year old who wears anywhere from 2t - 5t and my oldest wears up to a size 8 in girls and these still work pretty well for that size . anything after that and we use regular sized hangers 
i bought hanger clips to hang my daughter 's skirts and slacks . they are sold online or you can purchase them at most kid 's clothing stores . 
they can , but wo n't with out you wanting them to do so . 
i think they are more for kids sizes . the smallest size i 've used with them is 3t . 
not sure what you mean ? but i like it a lot it 's fast and on 110 
china 
no . the only plastic inside is the little filter in the spout , you can remove it . even at full water limit it does n't touch it anyway . 
whats wrong with the voltage where you live.i have no problem using my own in my house.so why wo n't you ship to singapore 
no ... this can use on only 110v . 
yes , i recently installed one in a stainless steel sink and also wrote a review of the product 
there is no definite lifespan . it depends on the pressure exerted on the sticker and the surrounding condition . we are confident the sticker can support the holder for at least 3 years under normal room temperature . 
sorry that i could not answer your question soon . unfortunately , your application is quite deviated from our current design . i do n't think our sponge holder is a right fit for those sponges with the soap in the handle . i will discuss your need with our team . thanks very much for the question . 
yes , our sticker will work on a composite sink . granite composite sinks are about 80 percent granite and 20 percent acrylic resin . since granite is a porous material , these sinks are prone to stains over time . because our sticker uses a clear adhesive and most of granite composite sinks are matte-finished , a mark can occur after removal depending on the compositions of the granite . in most cases , the mark is not noticeable . on the other hand , the area covered by the sticker is protected from daily use , as compared to the exposed area in the sink . at some point , the different could result in a mark . 
i have n't tried moving it , but the description says you can . 
it can hold just about anything . depending on the shape and size of the brush , it should fit through the center hole . 
mine did not wash well , it has big flat areas in it and i am very disappointed in this pillow . 
it will dissipate after some time . i let mine sit outside for a day in fresh air . the odor will fade . 
yes i do ! this is the best pillow ever 
queen 
i 'm not sure if it is required but i do . 
i never have washed it . 
all i did was wet the feet with a little water and push easy leg down . i do have a glass cutting board that stays on my counter that i stuck it to . you have to push pretty hard . 
they send you a copy of their pdf recipe book if you give the company your e-mail . once you receive your product , they send a follow up e-mail for you to sign up for one . 
i asked support about this before and was advised to do it this way : use your right arm to hold onto the vertical stand , where the active blade is ; and use the left hand to turn the spindle . the girl in the youtube video actually showed it could be done pretty easily : http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=dissjrx3wko 
yes it can work very well with big and long vegetables . there 's no container holding the vegs and it actually works better if the veg is thicker . 
yes i 'm able to spiralize sweet potatoes and winter squash easily with it . 
everything ... they want a happy customer 
no , i believe the thermometer can only reach 300 degrees . it has a hard plastic face and might melt , as well . i do put it in the warmer ( 165 degrees ) to check temps and it does great . 
yes . 
you can not leave it in the oven . you 'll have to pull the roast forward , insert the thermometer , turn it on after insertion then remove and push the roast back into the oven . 
i have the same problem ! i do n't know what to do and i worry that it is no longer accurate 
121mm 
yes i think it can be used as a candle thermometer . it has the range of temperatures you would need . and it can be used in short or tall molds . 
i ca n't say for sure , i purchased them for a client . i but i would say yes , the fabric is like a micro suede . fyi- we did have a few issues attaching the legs . one actually broke and we had to have replacement parts sent . they have a great look but if they are going to be used by kids or larger adults , buyer beware . 
dimensions are in the product description , these chairs are very comfortable and plenty plush enough for long board , card games or for sitting around the table and visiting . extremely pleased with this product . 
i did , but they should come with adjustable things on the bottom of the legs.. to make them higher or lower .. 
no , i do n't think so . sorry 
these pillows are all standard size from m'lily 
it is waffled and too hard and i do not like it . 
i sleep on my side and on my back . the pillow is ver comfortable for the most part but i wish it was bigger in general . i need more support under my neck and i feel it 's lacking in that . 
the main difference is that the gel swirl has temperature control so it does n't get hot in the summer . you can call sleep innovations directly for your firmness question . i know they are both about the same firmness . the sure temp ships faster . ( i 'm waiting for my gel swirl ) 
yes . any surface to place the 12 '' mattress on will work . i tried the mattress on the floor and the mattress felt fine . i had to return the mattress because the mattress was to firm for my small frame . 
yes . 
lol no . there isnt as much give as a normal matress but neither one of us noticed any complaints 
as long as it measures as a 1.25 '' inlet opening it will . thanks 
it worked with mine . 
cat hairs : terrific . i have two cats and it was able to get a bunch off from carpet about 3 hours after i had vacuumed with my old vacuum . best vacuum i have ever had for hairs . it does okay on my two rooms that have vinyl . one is my bathroom and it picks up all the litter around the litter pan . the brush attachment works well on hairs on furniture . there is nothing i dislike about this vacuum . the only drawback is that it is a little heavy , but it is still very easy to push . hopes this helps . 
perfect for small house . plug stores in vacuum and also power brush turns on and off for carpet or bare floor . 
yes there is . 
the wand hose is not really long enough to do more than 8 steps . 
no . you might want to check out a wet dry vac for that . 
yes , you may want to use the extension wand on the hose as well but you should be able to easily vacuum under a bed ! 
hi chef wannabe , this is the only steam convection toaster oven available from cuisinart at this time . 
no , but they slide in and out easily . i just let them cool off , or if i have to take them out when they 're hot , i use oven mitts . this is not exactly on point , but i love the machine . the steam-broiled chicken is delicious , and i 've made salmon as good or better than i do on the grill 
i steam vegetables , fish , farro , rice ... anything that taste best steam ... i also reheat leftovers with steam , so they do not get dried up . 
even if u could not worth it 
3 years 
yes , it is . with four bolts on the feet , it should withstand a karate kick . 
no there is no tilt option . this kit is literally a set of universal `` legs '' to replace the original stand that came with your tv . as a mount to stand your tv on a table top these are perfect . if you need a tilt , then i suggest you look at a wall mount . 
yes . it comes with multiple sizes of mounting screws . you should not have a problem . i 've bought multiple of this mount and have n't had a problem attaching to a tv yet . 
enough for 1 tv . each `` leg '' has 3 pieces that you put together . 
i would say probably not . my 42 '' lcd weighs around 60 lbs and seems surprisingly stable 
no , there is just not enough to hold it if it should start to sway back and forth . 
if your tv comes with the mounting bolts in the back , it should . 
no.. you ca n't turn it around so that the feet are facing the back of the tv ... they only stick out only like only 2.5 inches in front of the tv ... 
my unit did not come with a remote . 
about 2.5 ' tall and about 18 '' wide.. this unit that we have works great ! ! 
i do n't see why not . i would n't leave it on while i 'm not around the area for long periods though , indoor or outdoor . 
yes some type of resin . hard to tell that it is . very happy with it for what we use it for . 
yes it does : ) 
i think you can grill just about anything on it , we do hotdogs and chicken breast tenders , you can marinate your meat first , also you do n't have to do meat , if vegetarian you can grill veggies , it is totally non-stick surface , you can also grill sandwiches . it is very easy to operate , you plug it in and wait for the green light to come on , it is now ready . we can grill up to five foot long hot dogs or maybe 6 or 7 regular size at a time . it is big enough to grill two large hamburger or veggie patties or four small ones at a time . it is super fast and does not heat up the kitchen , so we use it a lot during the summer . i usually wipe it clean with a damp paper towel . or use a sponge with water and a squirt of dish soap then a damp paper towel . i think you can grill just about anything with it . i love mine ! 
only if they are removable . . . otherwise wipe down with soapy cloth then rinse off . the new models clean very easily . 
120v 1400watts 
no , you have to unplug when done or you want turned off ... . 
temp on this unit is a light thats red for warming up and green for done . very simple . 
the measurement is 7 3 4 inches both in width and length . 
yes you can . you can grill anything , i grill steak , chicken , fish 
no they can not be removed unless you unscrew them from the frame 
it 's on the handle , just where you would logically touch it with your thumb . very convenient ! 
remove the canister from the vacuum like you are going to empty it . then on the front of the canister the hoover logo is a clip , lift it slightly ( pull away ) and the top part pivots up . under that is the filter . you can now clean the whole canister and wash the filter . be sure squeeze out as much water as you can and then let it sit on its side for about a day before you re-install it . you can find this on page 11 of the product manual which you can download here : http : hoover.com file 581 if you do n't already have it . 
our bed is rather low , so it does not fit under it . however , our beds in the spare bedroom are higher , and it fits under those . 
yes and great suction . 
it does need to be emptied after every use , but its really simple to do . 
it has a range of at least ten feet , so take it from there . do n't aim it at computer equipment , especially a wireless router . mine accidentally got aimed at my router from about 8 feet distance , and my router started resetting itself over and over because of static buildup on the antennae . no permanent damage but very puzzling until i noticed i was getting a little zap when i touched the router , and then noticed the ionizer had been moved a bit . ( cats ) 
i do not know if it is replaceable , but they do have a guarantee . mine works great ! 
place the ionizer as high as possible in the room with nothing in front of it so it can project out in front of it . i do not use it when i sleep as the energy it gives off seems to keep me awake . 
hello , if you are asking if a static charge will develop around the surface of an object if the ionizer is aimed at the object - the answer is that it depends . for example , if you stand directly in front of the ionizer ( within a couple feet away from the ionizer ) and you are wearing shoes then your body will develop a slight static charge . however , if you are barefoot , then the floor will drain the charge away before your body has a chance to develop a static charge . 
the negative ions will interfere with the electromagnetic field generated by those devices and its possible to short them out and that would n't be good for you . 
hi , thanks for your question . the diameter of the base measures 4 inches wide . 
hi dfrandan , thanks for your question . the dripper is designed in the us and manufactured in china . 
hi deemom , thanks for your question . unfortunately , this listing only permits amazon prime purchases in the us . we 'd have to create a separate listing for amazon prime canada specific orders . feel free to reach out to us directly via our website at neecoffee [ dot ] com and we can handle your order separately . thanks ! 
it 's a little booklet that says thanks for purchasing the machine and it tells you all the flavors they carry and a short description of what aromas and characteristics each have . 
the nespresso welcome kit contains 16 capsules . 
yes , the credit is for any nespresso machine over $ 179 purchased anywhere between 11 29 13 and 1 26 14. see all t & c here : http : www.nespresso.com promotion us en yeppromo13 disclaimer . you must submit all required supporting documents . not that it does say valid in the us only . a great promo ! 
no , this unit does not come with a glass . 
yes it does come with a sample pod pack . 
yes . since the aeroccino is integrated . 
no it does not . 
china 
sometimes but not always . if it tips the lid fills and does n't drain back down in the bottom so when you take the lid off you get water on you which is a real mess . 
no 
nope , not at all . 
not unless it was a very skinny straw . there are 4 parts , the bottle itself , the main cap , the section that goes inside the bottle for fruit , etc. , which is perforated to allow the water to pass through for the infusion process , and the 'lid ' for that section , which has small , oval holes which sieve the infused water through . the 'lip ' you drink from is thin enough to where there is no 'dribbling ' when you drink . great contraption , i really like mine . 
yes . the menu selection comes with glutin rice , mixed rice , sushi rice , gaba rice , black bean , nu-rung-gi , nutri rice , porridge , multi cook , ferment bread baking , and auto clean . 
cooked 
this does n't have batteries , just power cord . 
yes , the product comes with an english manual as well as korean and chinese . 
yes this is made for use in usa . thanks 
hello lois - india . hope that helps . mike 
hello sandy - approximately 20oz . 
yes ! the traditional moscow mule recipe is printed on the box 
mine did n't . because i followed care instructions . wash them with luke warm soapy water and dry immediately 
it appears to be double walled 
ive had them a few months , no tarnish yet . 
the instructions say not to put it in the dishwasher or the microwave . 
the instruction sheet does n't say anything about it . my husband is around 220 lbs and they 've held up fine for him . they 're very sturdy . i hope that helps . 
they 're metal . 
15.5 inches 
the base of the seat 
thank you for your interest in out product . bar stool comes in color black white red only . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
yes , just like opening a jar 
there are n't holes but there is an air gap between the top and bottom which produces an amusing sort of vacuuming action , like it 's being sucked down through the bottom . hope that helps . 
`` passes the fda food grade material approval . made of acrylic , and stainless steel the aerator comes with a no-drip stand . '' 
you can use it for all wines , but i do n't see the point of aerating white wines . it 's mainly red wines that need aeration . 
this product was made in the united states.do not know what state.i love this aerator for the price you can , t go wrong great purchase.. 
vinara wine aerator works best with red wine and you can really notice the difference in smell and taste . 
i do n't know where it 's made nor can i compare it to vinturi as i have n't used that . however , i am very pleased with the aerator and have even given it as a gift . i 've been using it for months now and it 's highly durable ( not that aerating wine is a rugged job ) ! 
the county is not imprinted on the spatulas , but i seem to remember scratching off stickers that said they were made in china . 
up to 450f 
no 
it 's really a glider that rocks , so it does both 
no , it does not . 
on the side there is a plastic peice you pull .. 
19 inches 
i am not sure how to remove the back but since it had to be assembled ( put on ) when i got it , it should be fairly easy to disengage . there are instructions with the chair . 
i do n't know what ther specified weight i it is , but i have 2- 300 plus individuals sitting in the chair - no problem 
it is very light , i have a hard time lifting much of anything , and this is much lighter than the dc25 it replaced . i hope this helped . 
the box is 24 in x 10.5 in x 10 in and it weighs about 15 pounds . 
there are two attachment holders so if you have more than 2 attachments then no 
the dc50 comes with two attachments a small hard floor attachment and a skinny attachment . the vacuum weighs 12 lbs 5.44kg 
absolutely . the collection bin is a little small , so if you have a lot of hair to pick up , you will be emptying the bin frequently . otherwise , this is a spectacular vacuum . it cleans better , and maneuvers better than any other on the market . 
cord is a little over two feet long ( + - 26 '' ) . 
i wouldnt ! 
hi . i 'm not positive , however , i would think it should be no problem . 
no warming tray and a useless drip tray 
60hz . 
5 and 7 8 '' with the grind catcher removed . 
hi leo , i have n't used my moka with it yet , but i would guess that 12-13 ( untamped ) would be about right for most roasts . 
depending on your preference , roast , and beans used , i 'd say around 25 seconds . it does not have a grind timer , so you get to stand there with your finger on the button and let the noise , aroma , and anticipation carry you away ! 
32 '' x 32 '' 
it 's possible , but you might have to figure out a way to secure the legs from one table to the legs to the other if you do that or get one of those customized pads to lay across the two tables . seems like a good idea though . note : the legs have resin pads on their bottoms so the table does n't shift around on my hardwood floor which was a nice feature that came with the table . 
it is a pretty heavy table since it is solid wood ... as a result it is very sturdy . i ca n't give you the exact weight but it is significant . 
32 '' ~32 '' and 29 high.bult well 
the table is steady when set up but it is still a card table so is not made to sit on 
yes

so far i have only used it to melt crayon pieces into animal crayons . i used it in 250 degree oven for about 30 minutes twice so far . it did that very well and once cooled the crayons came out nicely from the tray . sorry i couldnt be more helpful . 
i believe only 1 mold is listed . it has 8 cavities and is very cute . 
i got the animals in the pictures ... .. 
i weigh 220 and mine completely collapsed on me and broke into about 7 different pieces . i would n't recommend this to anyone . it is down right dangerous . 
the bottom half is just at 1 '' while the top is a bit thicker around 1.75 '' . 
some times 
approx . 18 '' from top of handle to bottom of foot . we findthem very handy . 
i sent it to my daughter at college so i 'm not sure but she says it 's sturdy and holds her weight well but she only uses it to get up and down from her bunk bed . 
15 inches 
yes , it is available in king . but , we are currently out of stock . 
yes . 
hi sydney , you 'll get a comforter , bed skirt or dust ruffle , two pillow shams , 4 decorative pillows , 1 sheet set with fitted sheet , top sheet and two pillow cases . the packaging was perfect , pillows are filled with a very good foam that was nice and full when i opened the package . great price and i absolutely love this set . hope this helps . ps , the colors are true to the picture . 
it looks like the pillow case is folded in half in the picture.i think it is for one case . it would say cases meaning two but by the spelling its one case ... its been awhile since i bought mine but this is about right in price ... ..i really do like the case and its worth the money because it protects the pillow..at one time i did not use the case and had to wash pillow that was not a good thing ... . 
no it does not . i prefer it this way though because zippers tend to break easily . if you flip the cover inside out and cover the pillow that way , it is a lot easier to get it inside the case . 
sorry , i do n't know . this is a very long pillow case and i had to cut off the excess and the label would have been on that part . 
this pillowcase is 21 '' x60 '' . most body pillows are 21 '' x54 '' so the pillowcase fits perfectly . if your pillow is , in fact , 60 '' long , the pillow may come right to the end of the pillowcase . customers have told me they buy two pillowcases and put one on and then put the second one on the opposite way . this might work well for you as well . 
the pillowcase is 60 '' long . 
i ca n't honestly say for sure . i no longer have the packaging it arrived in . the tag inside says 100 % egyptian cotton and the company name is : american pillowcase . 
not that i know of but black+decker has a video at their website about the product it does show you how it is used . it 's pretty straight forward . easy to figure out . 
l:5 1 4 '' h:3.5 '' w:5 '' the charging base is mountable . 
black and decker manuals are available at http : blackanddecker.com manuals.aspx . 
if it is completely charged 15 minutes the most . 
hi paula , my name is austin . i 'm the vacuum product manager here at black+decker . the folded length is 10 inches . with the nozzle pivoted open it 's 16 inches . with the crevice tool extended it gets up to 19 inches . 
yes it can be . however you would need an adapter for the plug . input is 120-240,50 60hz , .3a 
no not a bit also if i have a glass of ice water in the late evening ( 9 pm ) and the ice is still there in morning ( 6 am ) . these glasses have really good stainless steel construction . 
definitely , the edge of the cup was very smooth 
no ... the inside of this cup is the same as the outside . stainless steel all around 
yes , you 'll love these stools ... you wo n't have to move them at all once you position the stools.. the base is wide and very comfortable so you can swivel and get out with ease . 
about 19 inches wide 
definitely not . they are designed to keep you seated upright , not for lounging . it 
they are great 
you just lift it off . 
the diameter of the base is 17 1 2 '' 
once the water boils , the beating element shuts off . you could cook eggs by leaving them in the hot water . 
nope . works great . 
its only setting is on or off . it is designed to boil water and turn off . 
china 
no , it is not very loud , it makes noise , but just regular boiling noise , nothing out of the ordinary . 
its faux leather and it looks great . it 's not shiny . it 's a nice clean lines . the texture is clean not bumpy or weird . looks like a ralph lauren design due to he clean lines and dimensions . i get a lot of compliments for it and people are surprised its faux leather . super happy with it . did n't expect i would like it so much . 
no . it pulls out and ends up being below the other mattress . 
it 's a clean white color . not so white that it looks bleached out . nice and bright and i am super happy with the quality and the size . it 's not overly thick on the sides . the white is a nice leather white color . not cream . 
the bed is 89 x 44 x 48 high . 
not sure of the exact type of wood , but definitely solid , not particle or plywood like . it is very sturdy . 
mine is espresso ... ..you 'll have to ask the company what they mean by cherry . thanks 
yes , i am 5'2 1 2 and i hit my head 
espresso ... like a very dark brown . 
i do n't know if they do or not . you 'll have to contact the company . i did n't need any when i put mine together 
no 
sweat shop in china ! 
yes , fits fine and having the kcups right there is very convenient . make sure that there is plenty of space under your cabinets with both the k75 and pod drawer stacked . ours fits nicely , but our daughter has to slide the unit forward out from under the cabinet to get the kcup inserted in the machine . 
it is bamboo 
yes you can . 
yes it will and that is what we did with ours 
yes it will . the keurig sits on top of it . 
it is 3 3 16 inches . 
hi . the difference is that the 1575 model has the diamond shape pitcher . i do n't think that there is much difference with the wattage . thanks 
no 
yes , i do it all the time . it is no problem . 
yes , absolutely 
no , the carafe is some type of plastic . it has no plastic smell to it , however . 
no they do n't make glass for this model . the only glass one is the ksb565er model which i only have red at this time . thanks 
it 's actually 2 seperate beds that sit side by side inside of a king size bed frame . each bed operates seperately and independently of each other . 
no , they are made for a 2xtwin xl adjustable bed . that is called a split king 
they were perfect for my split sleep number . not sure for sleep comfort 
yes 
is made in china . 
the dimensions of the little modern table and chairs are l 28in x w 19 in x h 20 in and weighs 17.3 lbs . 
i am sorry i do n't know i just found the one that was for my model number and it worked . sorry i could n't help u . 
do n't know 
it worked for me . yes . 
hi , the manufacturer recommends not exceeding 250 lbs total weight on the frame . 
yes , i have plastic bins under it . thin ones as the clearance is not too high 
our twin trundle fits under the twin daybed . 
product dimensions : 76.5 x 40 inches , platform height=15 inches , arm height=32 inches 
i would say 2-3 inches.. let 's put it this way.. i felt i needed to get a box spring.. or at least have a board on the bottom of the mattress with no box spring . i opted for the box spring ( on sale , dirt cheap , at bjs.. ) 
most orders ship out within one business day . time in transit to md is 2-3 business days . 
our twin trundle frame will fit . here is a link : http : www.amazon.com gp product b00kya1l7w 
yes . the light is a separate button . we run ours at night with the light off . love it ! ! 
distilled white vinegar works wonders for cleaning . be careful when cleaning the ionizer area . 
what you do is just put a few drops in the water . 
it does n't specify . i was concerned as well about that . i doubt it though because it seems like a really cheap product . lightweight $ 20 cheap item , although it 's $ 60 . i would n't recommend . 
no ! super quiet . i have a vicks humidifier that is so noisy . with this one you can barely tell it 's on . 
in the description it says it is bpa free . 
it says made in china on mine ! 
yes , they are 100 % , bpa free & fda approved : ) 
it is the standard size cup which means it is the same size as most of the cups available and fits perfectly into the regular muffin pan if necessary , so the same size as the cupcake papers available . 
yes 
silicone 
yes ! 
yes 
yes it does . 
i have the keurig 2.0 k500 , but they should work with any 2.0 machine . they include orange stickers you need to apply to the top , then they work . 
as long as it says all 2.0 brewers it should work fine . mine came with orange stickers to put on the top and only worked once i put them on . good luck 
yes 
yes , if you tare the weight with something on the scale and then take it off , it will tell you the negative weight . ( negative weight meaning what the object on the scale weighted , before taring the scale back to 0 . ) 
on the underside there is a small removable cover , similar to radios and remote controls , remove the cover and replace the batteries . simple and quick . when you use the scale , if you do n't turn it off it will automatically turn itself off in about a minute so it does n't run down the batteries . i had mine almost a year before i had to replace the batteries and i was using it daily . 
no . manufacturer states that it is not waterproof . i have spilled wet ingredients in small amounts on the glass top and that is ok. the top surface is easy to clean with a damp cloth and that is also ok per manufacturer . i do n't know what would happen if a cup of water was turned over near it , although it does sit a bit above the counter on tiny rubber pads . 
with a damp rag after normal use . every so often , we use a mild cleaner like windex on it . 
yes it can . 
2 aaa 
i do n't care where it was made . it arrived with corroded batteries . 
well it keeps out cats , and i suppose it would keep out mice as well . the color is more of a deep salmon than a true red 
16 '' x 9 1 2 '' wide and 7 '' high . it is a nice big size . 
hello elaine , this item does come in black ( model # bb40201 ) , the red of course ( model # bb40202 ) , and stainless steel chrome ( model # bb00085 ) . i hope this was helpful for you . 
black edges are rubber . 
42 
yea 
yes 
4 
it actually comes with a permanent filter 
i honestly do n't know . did you break yours ? bella has a website - customer service could answer that better than me . would like to know what you find out so please post ! good luck ! http : www.bellahousewares.com beverages coffee-and-tea 
no , two . i love mine ! 
plastic 
i really do n't know . 
according to the rubbermaid website , they are definitely bpa free . here is the link : http : www.rubbermaid.com pages learnaboutbpa.aspx hope this helps : - ) 
the inner part that slides into the pitcher is 6.0625 '' the top or outer part is about 6.25 '' 
no 
yes , fully functional on both sides although only one side has the routed - groove for liquids . very nice unit . 
i use the common mineral oil available at the grocery store -- works well ! i try to remember to apply it once a week . i 've really enjoyed this cutting board . 
hello , this bamboo cutting board is manufactured in china . 
not really a top or bottom , one side is flat and one side has a groove ( as seen in photo ) 
yes 
i have not had problems with it slipping around , but maybe i do n't go at as aggressively as you do . i have also not had any problems with it splitting , but do not use very often and have not used it for meat yet , so have only had to rinse it off lightly . 
i think it would , though i have n't used it in that situation . 
yes 
yes 
no you cant . 
generally pods can be used with espresso machines if there is an appropriate and associated pod filter . the bes870xl barista express does not come with a pod filter . it is highly recommended that pods not be used on this espresso machine . 
1. coffee bean hopper redesign 2. more control over brew temperature ( pid ) 3. added hot water dispenser 4. auto shut-off function 5. the bes870xl 's power input is at 1600 watts vs. the 1450 watts in the bes860xl . 6. included a dosing tool called `` razor '' 
the bes870xl barista express is designed to grind beans for espresso . all of the settings on it are usable for espresso depending on the type of roast , the age of the bean , and personal preference . we recommend that you add in beans to the hopper initially and , while it is running , adjust it to the middle setting . from there you can either make the grind finer or coarser depending on the results you receive . 
we use a small . separate grinder for decaf beans . once ground we simply spoon them into the double walled porta filter . works every evening for us . 
no but it makes terrific espresso , and espresso drinks and is fast heating and easy to use and clean . 
china 
8 1 2 but that includes the bent part . 
not at all , just too small for my needs 
yes 
there are 4 straws in the package along with a brush for cleaning . 
stainless steel 
does not have temperature control but the rack is somewhat adjustable . two settings one closer to the element and one further away from the element . 
better build and a little bigger . i 'm too happy with this one . 
felicitas . it does very well on a 1inch steak . 
the top grate is stainless steel . the rest of the bbq wipes down easy with disinfecting wipes ( my preferences ) . also add a little a little water in bottom drip tray before cooking for a easier clean up . this is our second one and love ! love , love it . 
no we do n't . sorry . 
110v standard u.s. style plug 
the cooking dimensions of the grill are 13 inches by 7.9 inches thank you 
i use the grill almost every day if not twice a day . it 's one of the few grills without teflon which i 've heard can cause cancer . i like the fact that the fat drips below without getting back on the food . i ca n't digest any type of oil or fat so it 's essential for me to have this type of grill if i 'm to cook something . i 'm very happy with the grill . it took me long enough to find it , and i 'm glad that amazon had it . 
i received a dozen but you must find such an offer , since some are each . read the item page carefully and ask the seller if unclear . i sifted through a lot to find the dozen offer for this price . 
yes . there is a washable primary filter but the hepa exhaust filter must be replaced . 
yes , it has a hepa filter . it also has a general filter that can be washed . 
the power head is multi purpose . adjusts up and down , 
yes 
yes 
this vacuum does a much better than average job on stairs . the motorized head is light and swivels easily . it has great pick-up , and a light on the head . the entire vacuum is very light and easy to carry on stairs . the crevice tools los work well on stairs . the long cord is plenty for he stirs in most homes . 
casters wheels ... yes 
no , but like every other appliance , you do n't want to overload the circuit you plug it into . it will use 1500 watts which is almost a hair dryer . i have been using over a month now and have not noticed any dimming of lights or flickering when the heat comes on . 
the dimensions are 28-1 4 '' wide x 10-3 4 '' deep x 22-1 2 '' tall . 
it would have to be turned back on . i hope this is helpful . 
hello there ! the btus for this unit is rated at 5100 . 
yes , just take it out of the box , plug it in , put batteries in the remotes and it 's ready to go . 
yes , we move it all the time . 
yes 
it is not . you could , but do not want to put these as it wears the healthy coating of the pan . you will notice a decrease in even heating after some dishwashing . also changing from hot to cold too quickly ( running under cold water wright off stove0 will wear it out . i always wipe clean while still warm and it cleans super easy . worth the hassel for a better functioning pan in my opinion ! 
no . not at all . 
no lid i 'm using an old one when needed not perfect but works 
here is a link to the lid which can be purchased separately : http : www.amazon.com ozeri-zp-26gl-green-frying-10-inch dp b006qcl672 ref=sr_1_2 ? s=home-garden & ie=utf8 & qid=1389169402 & sr=1-2 & keywords=ozeri+lid hope this helps 
this question was already answered ( see below ) . it has a lifetime warranty against defects . 
yes 
i would say about 1.5 inches deep 
hi , you can fry fish and chicken but not a deep fry . i use a small amount of oil with the oster on a medium heat and brown each side then reduce the heat , cover and cook until done . my one word of caution is the middle does get quite hot because of the element so watch the food close to the center . good luck and happy cooking ! this is a fun little cooker and you will be so surprised how may meals it will provide ! so fry away ! remember ... . easy with the oil and you will be fine . have a great day ! 
1200 watrs 
yes , it is very durable . i have found it to be more so than any teflon coated pan i have owned . the only problem that i have found is that the area where the heat ring is gets extremely hot , and cooks things quicker when the stuff is on that area of the pan . my suggestion , just keep stirring , turning , or rotating the stuff . 
i believe it 's 190 ( i 'm at work so not sure ) . it has a simmer setting and that works great ! i browned some frozen perogies last night , but felt the middle of the potato could of been hotter . i set the skillet to simmer and left it for about 15 minutes . the inside was real hot after that , but the outside never burned 
i do n't know without a scales , but it is as light as the old style non-stick electric fry pan i had . i doubt it is more than 2 pounds . i consider it light-weight . sorry i ca n't be specific , but i 've never beeen able to cook as quickly and to my taste as with this product . clean up is a breeze . 
this electric skillet is designed with unique , innovative duraceramic non-stick ceramic coating . it is not necessary to add oil or cooking spray to the surface before cooking . 
110watt , cooks great . 
hi vinod , these are the exact same bowls as the ones listed at $ 26.46 . i hope that helps . 
they are 13 oz 
thank you for writing in ! each of the wean green tempered glass containers holds 13 ounces . i hope that helps ! 
i have mainly used it for drying pots and pans . i had the few times i use silverware i put them thru the wires to stay in place . 
bare 
about 9 inches . 
nope . not a bit 
there 's a hechscher on the box from the london beis din and underneath the hechsher it says in english : `` manufactured by a jewish company tevilah not required '' there 's also a statement in hebrew that the urn was manufactured according to the psak of rav moshe feinstein & # 1494 ; & # 1510 ; & # 1524 ; & # 1500 ; and that the urn does not require tevila . 
approximately 40 minutes . this pot totally failed after only 8 months of use . the manufacturer replaced the pot with a new one under warranty . the last hot water i purchased was made by regalware but has been discontinued . it worked flawlessly for 10 years . 
no 
it 's not hot enough to burn you , but i would keep it away from children . i run mine 24 7 
this machine is only 110v not 220v . 
i have n't timed it , but it seems like about 20 minutes ... 
they are all the same size but different shapes.. they are really neat.. i really like them 
no 
hello ashley , i hope this message finds you well . the total chalkboard labels is 12. they come in a pack containing 2 sheets which are 8.6 '' x 11 '' . one sheet contains 6 pieces . each chalkboard label is 3.6 '' x 2.6 '' . the shapes are based on a rectangular frame with varying degrees of rounded edges . please see the photos for some examples of the chalkboard stickers . please feel free to contact us if you have any other questions . thank you 
yes , as long as it 's dry when it 's put on . at least it has stayed on for me . 
hello carolyn , yes the chalkboard labels can be used on plastic containers . as the stickers have an adhesive back , they are suitable for most smooth surfaces . customers have even used the chalkboard labels on baskets to help organize storage areas . all the best . 
yes it does 
this is the second one of these i have owned . the first one lasted several years and the door hinge broke . decided to replace the entire oven rather than try to repair . have not used any other brand or any other krups . i love it . it is about the only oven i ever use ... .especially in the summer ... .large oven makes the house too hot . can make almost anything in the small convection oven that can be made in the large oven and it tastes just as good and much more cost effective . only use the large oven occasionally . 
one year warranty . 
for normal bread , you flip the grate around to centre it in the oven , there is a `` toast '' button and then up down buttons for length of time for toasting . i find that even with the grate centred , the toast browns slightly more on the top than the bottom . for buns , i leave the grate lower in the oven and toast that way as it centres the buns better . 
yes it is lit with a blue background for a few seconds after the oven finishes cooking , but other than that it is an unlit lcd ( black on gray ) 
it is about 20 1 2 '' wide ( with handles ) , 14 1 2 '' deep and 10 1 2 '' high . i love it . 
12 inches 
yes it is and you can do your own homemade pizza , 
frozen are the only kind i have used . i do n't make them fresh 
it 's a good size . it 's 2 1 2 inches . i make pizza 's , warm up biscuits , make toast . we love it ! ! 
yes the handle does fold . 
the only description given is 3 '' thick . 
no idea . 
anything that is not stainless steal is mad of rubber or silicone 
sorry i have no way to measure them . maybe 1 4 
yes , that 's what i have . fits perfectly ! 
yes , it seems to 
yes this will fit the bigger nutri bullet not the smaller magic bullet blender . 
i do n't know . i bought these for my bullet ( not sure of the model ) and they are a misfit . 
no 
no these gasket will not fit any nutri bullet rx model . 
it fits the `` nutribullet '' not nutribullet rx . i am not familiar with 600 series . i only know the units as tribullet . 
there was n't on the ones i purchased . 
i have a nutribullet . not sure if it is the rx or not . got it one year ago . these fit great . have only used one but have a spare now . 
you get two pillow covers for the big ones and then you get the round pillow , small rectangular one and a square one ! its a really cute set all you need is a comforter to fill in the duvet 
buttons and it 's such a cheap fabric i threw it away ... i do n't recommend u buying it ... looks pretty but feels so cheap 
no idea . it 's polyester and hot and sweaty and i do n't recommend it . 
pretty positive they are . i 've left mine sitting in the sink for a couple of days in a row with no signs of rust . my old ones would start to rust after just a few hours . 
yes , and very sharp ! 
box say 's made in china 
yes 
yes , it does 
yes you could . the wine bottle storage part is just two interlocking pieces of particle board , so you could easily leave that out 
wine rack can easily be not installed . it is the weakest and easiest part to install . 
black is the only color i have right now . have a great day . 
yes , cheaply made . we received ours with no cutouts for the hardware and it was cut wrong . the hardware we did receive was not for this piece of furniture . do n't spend your money on this . 
i only use this device with an n64 . there is no button input lag or loss of picture quality . 
most newer tv 's have a usb connection , i believe it comes with a usb cord for power , use the tv 's usb port to power it up . if you tv does n't have a usb port then get a basic usb adapter for power , like a phone charger . hope this helps . 
that was exactly my situation . i had a vcr that only output composite video and stereo audio ( y- video , white and red - left and right audio ) . you connect this device to the y-w-r outputs from the vcr , then connect the hdmi cable between this device and your tv ( or av receiver ) . it 's that simple . to power the device , you must also connect a usb cable to anything in your equipment rack that also has a usb port . newer tvs and av receivers have usb ports . you will need a usb cable that is long enough to reach your power source ( i had to replace the one they sent me with one of my own ) and of course the y-w-r cable that connects between your vcr and the device , which you should already have assuming the vcr was previously connected to an older piece of equipment . it worked like a charm . 
i do n't think so , this device suppose to enable connecting new hdmi devices into old composite connection and translate sound and image accordingly . to write record or burn dvds using a pc would require a software like nero toast etc . these softwares prepare media prior to fit a dvd before it does it . i assume you could record onto your pc by this would require a recording or a grabbing software . unless someone has more enlightened answer that 's the best of my knowledge . 
yes , rca on input , hdmi out to tv . 
sure will . most importantly you will also need a source of usb power for the device as well . if your receiver has a usb port , you 're fine and can use that . if not any cell phone charger should probably do the trick as well . comes with a usb cable but not the ac adapter . works great ! 
i specifically bought this converter so that i could hook up my original wii to my a v receiver over hdmi . i am not hooked up to a 4k source , but my receiver is a newer yamaha hdmi receiver and this product let me easily connect the wii to it . the picture and sound are both great . 
no , it works the other way round . composite -- to -- & gt ; hdmi 
it must be mounted not only to a wall but to studs in the wall so i would recommend purchasing a stud finder with this item . 
no , just the headboard 
it comes in three pieces . the total length is 125.5 inches . the main part that goes above the bed is 78 inches long . the two parts that are attached to the nightstands are 23.75 inches each . 
this is only a queen headboard . it mounts on the wall . you can buy the matching platform bed or use your own bed frame 
well the headboard and nightstands all rest on the same `` track '' - you can hang the track at any height your want , but you ca n't hang the nightstands at a different level then the headboard . they rest perfectly next to it though 
we ordered a king size so do n't know about queen size 
according to package directions , you are to spot clean only . do not put in washer or dryer . do not immerse in water . 
i ordered this blanket almost a year ago for my 9 yr old granddaughter . i had doubts that the lights would work well much last for long . to my amazement , it is still working beautifully a year later . she loves it and uses it lots in winter and even in summer for fun in the dark . it is white and she is careful to keep it clean . spills can be wiped off with damp cloth . a great investment that made a sweet little girl very happy . 
yes they do 
i have no idea . a gift for 10 yr old granddaughter she loves it ; has had it for 6 mis and lights still working 
no , it is a child size blanket . my granddaughter 's blanket failed right after amazon 's return period ran out , so my granddaughter is now without her blanket . 
neither , thereis electrical wiring indide 
i have a large living room , dining room , kitchen combo and another 10 x14 room off of the dining room . all connected . the heater does work well down into the 30s but it runs all the time . it does n't put out a large amount of heat but it keeps the main living room cozy . it would have to be a smaller area to make it get too hot . it will not replace your furnace but it does help to keep the furnace from coming on as much . i had a 4 element heater but returned it right away and bought this product instead . 
hi , there is a 1 year manufacturer 's warranty for defects on workmanship . if there are any issues at all , we can be reached here through the amazon sellers message board and will gladly assist you . i hope this helps . please let us know if we can possibly help with anything else . thank you !

21 '' x 12 '' x 6.5 '' 
it 's about 21 '' x 12 '' , and about 7 '' deep . 
it depends on how much ice you put in and what size beverage containers . last time i used it , i filled it with ice and put in about 16 beer soda bottles . 
plastic 
not like a thermos , since it is plastic . but it is crystal clear and cold for that first cup of coffee on the drive to work . 
very easy the lid just slides off , and wash regularly . not intended for dishwasher . 
yes 
i bought the mattress . i went to the makers site and read allthe specs there . it is very informative . go there and find your answer . 
for me it 's perfect . i guess i would consider it on the firm side of medium . 
yes you can 
no , it is just a straight shaft . it would be pretty easy to rig up something i think . 
yes you can use it on candy or maple syrup . basically any liquid or solid that you need to get the temperature of . the temp range is -40 to +450 . i know maple syrup making is quite the detailed process so hopefully someone with experience on that end can weigh in here . we have had plenty of people use the thermometer for candy making and it works perfectly 
sorry , i can not help you , if it is not shown in mfg . details . i gave it as a gift , and can not recall 
as i may have mentioned in the review , in ice slush it measures 32f and is also spot on with the predicted boiling temp at the elevation of abq ( 200f ) but that varies slightly with weather . i 'd guess + - one degree , but have just the one sample and no ast certified thermometers with which to compare . 
no it 's not constructed for oven use . for starters the buttons are rubber . you would have pull your meal oit if the oven to take temp . 
surprisingly no , very soft and comfortable . does fray around the edges .

there is only one small tray for poaching . you might be able to fit two cracked eggs in there , but only one poaching dish is provided . you can however soft boil 7 eggs . 
i had best results with a soft boil of whole egg . i did n't try too hard to get a good poached egg . 
i do n't recommend trying to scramble eggs in your electric egg cooker . it 's very convenient for boiling eggs perfectly every time , with hardly any effort . also poaching . but i 've never tried scrambling in my cooker . 
not real well . is soft boils ok in the shell but cup provided stills leaves some uncooked but i 've found it m akes a very good rice and small amount of vegatable steamer . maybe if you punched some small holes in cup tolet it drain it would do better ? but small enopuhg so egg wo n't leak through ? 
comes with a small plastic bowl cup you can poach eggs in 
it can steam 7 eggs in their shells at once , or poach 2-3 eggs ( out of shell ) in a little tray provided 
no 
heavy plastic 
that is already factored in - this is the discount off single units 
this is discount off single unit pricing 
yes it is returnable but buyer is responsible for freight charges 
this fits any body pillow . 
it is not listed on the tag . sorry , i ca n't help you . 
thank you for your inquiry . the body pillow case is 100 % cotton . please let us know if you have any questions . thank you , beyond bedding customer service toll-free : 1-866-999-6255 
jonathan - these are 3 separate units , so yes , you see the transition from one unit to another . if you have the units on a hard-surfaced floor , and you put the units together correctly , the transition will be hardly noticeable . the units are dark , so if you are standing a distance from them , the transition is difficult to see . our units are on a carpeted floor , so it takes some extra effort to make sure you have them level in all directions in order to avoid a visible separation . if you want something that looks like one unit , one that shows no transition , then you need to have a single unit built . we are very pleased with these units . they look nice and the quality , for the money paid , is great . ours are loaded with books and pottery and other small art pieces , and they look great . hope this helps . 
this particular item has 3 pieces . you can also by them separately if you want but the listings will be different . 
it ship via fedex ground . they do not bring it inside . 
hello . it is made of engineered wood with a scratch and stain resistant laminate finish . 
according to the manufacturer it is 850 watts 
850 watts very good power+it has a glass jar everything else out there on the market is plastic . 
it can crush olaf from frozen . 
pretty much , yeah , it did for me . i do n't remember trying to put anything together except for the general assembly of it because they package everything in the safest way . 
without tearing a box apart , i 'm realatively certain it is imported from korea 
nope . there 's pretty noticeable gaps between the glass plates . it 's not bad , but if you have something very sensitive to dust , this might not be what you need . 
nope . it is not . 
yes , it just takes a little time to put it together 
yes will definitely fit.. 
not sure , i bought this for my mom . but , i can tell you she has the shelves filed with ask her nice china . has n't been a problem . 
14 inches deep x 16 inches wide x 62 inches high 
clicks pulls open from the front 
yes you can , hard to put together . but looks nice and opens easily . 
i would say pure whit . definitely no blue-and no yellow towards cream 
these are so simple that matching will be easy . personally , i use them with other serving dishes to add pops of color or to change with the season . 
no , they are not hot . i put them in the microwave often and never have a problem . 
the dinner plate is 10-1 4 inches and the salad plate is just under 8-1 4 inches 
avalon run i purchased because it is bone china . it is dishwasher & microwave safe . it is white , simple can go with any type of decor , food ... great buy ! 
as you can see , it 's somewhat shaped like a tulip . it measures approximately 1 inch at the very bottom with a lip that allows it to stand on its own on the counter . it flairs out and i measured it at 3.5 inches across the top . when it 's in the water , it floats well above the very top of the poacher , so that allows you enough room to grab two tips to remove when your egg is done . i love mine ! 
all you need it a big spoon . i use a slotted cooking spoon , but any kind of big spoon to get under the pod is all you need . it 's very easy once the egg is cooked , it 's not going to slide out . 
i just use a soapy sponge and rinse it well . i used it last night . i rub the inside with some soft butter , put the eggs in , then float into a pot of simmering water and put the lid on . they came out perfect ! ! ! 
mine works beautifully and has since day one . perhaps you are using a weaker blend of coffee it 's self or are using a choice of cup too large for your particular brand of coffee . i find some of the breakfast blends are a weaker coffee flavor . use a smaller cup choice when you brew . if that does n't work may i suggest that you have gotten a coffee maker that just does n't work properly . even the best of man made products are not always perfect ; i think they call them lemons , but that does not make them all lemons . send it back and try another one , kuerig is a very fair company and i am sure they will work with you . hope this helps . 
it is just over 8 '' from counter to the top of the tallest cup you can use . the machine has a removable 2 '' drip tray , but if you do n't use the tray you could easily get an 8 '' cup under the spout . if you leave the drip tray in , your max cup height would be 6 '' . the tray easily removes and goes back into place in a millisecond . it does catch the occasional drip and holds about 8 oz fluid for those times when you are really in a hurry and forget to put any size cup under it ! however , without it you just want to keep a napkin or paper towel handy for the occasional small drip . 
yes 
this uses keurig 05073 size filters . i have been using generic replacements for the keurig filters , and they work fine . 
yes it will make ice tea . fill a glass that will fit under the brewer with ice and brew a kcup of tea . you may want to use a plastic tumbler as the glass may shatter . 
yes . do n't use a k-cup , select your cup size , and press `` brew . '' 
sure . just do n't put a k-cup in the brewer , select your cup size and press `` brew . '' 
about 2minutes 
they will hold 8oz . each . 
it comes with a small booklet with eighteen 5 minute recipes , no pictures just recipes . poached eggs , egg omelet , baked apple crisp dessert , the baked onion trick , french onion soup , fresh tomato sauce , shrimp scampi , chocolate souffle , maple sweet potatoes , eggplant parmesan , healthy veggie chili , loaded diced potato , broccoli garlic saute , green bean almondine , spicy sesame green beans , honey glazed carrots , zucchini and tomato saute and , baked banana dessert . fyi , after using it a couple of times , they spend most of the time on the shelf . 
like so many things today , they are made in china according to the box . 
yes . each one of them comes with a separate book . 
no , it ca n't 
i have no idea ... sorry . 
yes , the water collect in the bottom clear tray . it is a standard light bulbs . this is an electric fountain . it will turn on if there is an electric power . 
i do n't know because mind stop too . 
yes 
i would not -- juice pulp would clog . can not use champagne because bubbles air carbonation interrupt the flow . only water would be my suggestion . 
yes it does . its a great buy and it has an on off switch if you would preffer the lights off . 
60 inches 
it needs a foundation . i put it in a rv with a platform and did n't need a boxspring . if you use it on a regular bedframe you will need a boxspring . 
yes that should work fine . i put mine on top of a toddler car bed and it has slats and bunkie board . as well . and works just fine . its soooo comfortable to . 
from the amazon product page : product details size : queen product warranty : for warranty information about this product , please click here [ pdf ] product dimensions : 79l x 60w x 9 inches deep shipping weight : 40 pounds ( view shipping rates and policies ) asin : b00igi5ac6 item model number : udcqeuro-q_c5 average customer review : 4.5 out of 5 stars 
yes you can use it on an adjustable frame , as long as the frame is big enough . i used it on a `` portable frame '' and it is amazingly comfortable and supportive . 
sorry i did n't pay that much attention to the title . i will update my review soon and may be able to address it then . 
no lid came with mine . i 'm going to contact the seller because the answer posted here says that a lid is included . meanwhile i have a silicone splatter shield that fits just about right , but it ca n't seal the pan because it 's intended to ventilate . it works for frying though . starfrit 93038 silicone splatter screen here on amazon . 
yes - you use but it needs be done very carefully and slowly and on an angle ( i am presuming that your edge id on one side of the knife ) . i would use it only a few times - less that you would for a normal knife . i only other way to do a serrated edge knife is to buy the right size round fine file and do each grove 1 by 1 - it takes a lot of time and skill to the right angle for every groove . most home cooks would get it wrong and end up with an uneven blade . hope that helps . 
there are two fixed angles -- one at the top for sharpening knives , the other lower for sharpening scissors and other implements . it takes a screwdriver and some fuss to change from one to the other , which is why i suggested a person should own two units -- one for each type of sharpening without the bother of switching back and forth between them . 
not electric ... works well though . suction clamp to counter and just slide knife through sharpener on top . we like ours . 
3-4 pulls through the sharpener , just as advertised . hands down the best sharpener i 've ever used . 
i do n't know . i examined the sharpener , but saw no indication of where it was made . perhaps someone with the original packaging might be able to tell . 
i do n't believe so . i could barely sharpen my scissors with it . 
i was able to sharpen mine . love this item . 
do n't know , but all i can say is that it is the best thing i have ever used on my knives . got sick of having to wait for hubby to sharpen them , now i can do it in a flash . 
yes , i saw that review , too . i will start by saying i have three cast iron teapots . a green one for green teas , a blue one for black teas , and this one for herbal , fruity or flavored teas . i do not scrub my cast iron teapots but i do wash and rinse them out from time-to-time . i have not observed anything flaking off in any of my teapots . this one appears to be just as good as the green one i purchased some years ago from teavana for almost double the price of this one . 
the color is exactly as it shows and the stand that comes with it is a big plus . i love this teapot . 
it fills a little more than two 8-oz mugs . not quite 3 . 
no , cast iron is not tended to be used for a stove top . you want to boil the water then add it to the pot and step the tea . 
i do not know . there is no markings on it . sorry i could not help . 
unsure . it never ran long enough to find out all of functions or what they did ! can tell you when it worked it did exactly what we wanted , but after a few hours it would stop , you would have to `` clean it '' . returned for a holmes that has worked continuously without fail for weeks now . 
this is a filter less humidifier 
unfortunately not ... .but the light is dim enough that it should not bother a person . our next version will have that option coming in nov. 2014 . 
that 's exactly what they 're for & they are wonderful ! ! 
i have a large hand , but never the less i was able to fit it because they stretch . i think a loose fit would actually be a benefit because it would harder to cut yourself with a loose glove . 
the gloves can be hand washed or machine washed at 80 c with a little detergent , they should be either drip or air dried , do not use tumble drier and do not iron 
this product contains 2 gloves , they are identical and will fit either the right or left hand , use both at once or keep one as a spare 
i do n't think they are lead . here is what nakpunar says about their jars ... the jars we sell have special bpa free lids and you can use them for foods . they can also be waterbath for the jams . apr 22 , 2014 by nakpunar 
they are 2 inches tall with the cover on . 
i sort of doubt it . the seal is n't that tight . however , i have never tried to seal them in a water bath . i only use them to hold small amounts of different oils i mix with other oils . 
they are just 6 jars in a single order . 
i 'm not 100 % sure , but i can tell you that ours have gone in the dishwasher many times without a problem . 
we put honey in ours , which we do n't want to heat . that being said , if the lids are screwed on , i think these could easily break in the oven . you might try one without the lid and see what happens . glass is often used in ovenware , but not with a sealed lid . the contents could expand with heat . 
only when it shows signs of dirtiness 
china 
no , on page 2 of the instruction booklet it says , `` do not peel or poke holes in the potatoes ! '' 
yes i used high 
sadly , you can do the same thing in a brown paper bag 15 seconds . 
i 've tried various temperatures and the bag still does not cook my potato as advertised . 
the exterior is 100 % polyester . the lining is 85 % polyester and 15 % cotton . you wash it inside out and lay it flat to dry . ps it says it will hold up to 4 potatoes . my 2 russets filled it up . 
not advised . i tried & burned the bag . cook 3 1 2 minutes . remove & toss potatoes a little check doneness then cook additional time as needed . just not over 4 minutes at a time . i have much success this way . good luck . 
no it 's 48 inches high , make time to assemble ! ! ! looks great 
very compact for all the space it provides . basically it 's 4 feet in height , less than 2 feet sticking out from the wall and just over 2 feet lengthwise 
we currently have a 40 '' on it , however it is only 16 lbs ! not sure about 35lbs ! 
yes 
yes 
14 '' deep x 18 '' wide ... yes 
the lower 4 shelves are 20 '' wide the top shelf is 27 '' 
i have it in front of me and it measures exactly 48 '' to the top of the highest shelf . i think it says this in the ad , and can confirm that . 
15by27 inches 
margaret , you can also put it in the dishwasher . works just fine . ... deb at hc essentials 
absolutely not . any damage to the mat , it should be discarded , according to the manufacturer . fire issue maybe ? i 'd just buy a new pan to fit the mat . 
i 'm sure it has a 30 day money back guarantee , but you wo n't need it . the mat works really well ! 
this will expose the edges of fiberglass and even though they cut a silpat in this : http : jetcitygastrophysics.com 2011 04 28 modernist-cuisine-at-home-mushroom-omelet i would n't recommend it unless you repaint coat the edges . 
the silicone baking mats are made in china to the highest quality specs and are fda approved . the owner of hanson creek personally traveled to china to inspect the silicone baking mat . thank you for your question- the hanson creek team 
yes 
not worth it . package itself was not good and the regulator was broken.. dont go for it.. 
i bought this pressure regulator because it was advertised as fitting all presto models . well , it sure does n't fit mine ! 
yes and fairly easily . 
unfortunately no . 
yes , it shuts off on it 's own with a loud beep to let you know . you can also adjust the time while it 's baking . we 're going on 2yrs with this little oven and it still works like new . wo n't buy any other brand from now on . 
i have no idea for i never used it . 
no it does n't , you have to pull the rack out yourself .

unfortunately we do n't ship outside usa . 
20 '' x 16.5 x 8.5 '' 
it is located in the bottom back of the unit . 
it is warm air . 
its an odd size , not a garden hose . i found hose close enough and put a clamp on it to hold it in place . works fine , better than trying to empty the bucket . 
the fan stays on all the time . 
16.14x8.27x21.46 inches or 41x21x54,5 cm weight27.6 pounds 
made in china stamped on bottom of pot . i do really like the pot , but i had hoped it was made in england 
it is unlikely because ( 1 ) it is made in china , ( 2 ) the lid did not fit the pot [ no indent to sit flat and keep the lid from falling off ] , ( 3 ) i thought to use it for a pot of tea , but after heating the pot with hot water and dumping it - i noticed the inside of the pot was covered in black spots that could not be removed . i wanted to return it - but the company said i could keep it and they would refund my money . it is an embarrassment to have `` english tea '' associated with the name . i threw it in the trash . do not waste your money . buy an authentic brown betty teapot or other name brand - cheap price means a cheap product . 
no . i would not recommend stacking them ... 
it 's a little over 5 inches tall 
yes , they work perfectly in the microwave . they never come out hot to the touch ( we 've only microwaved them for 2minutes at most ) . we use them every day . great glass ! 
i never have attempted to put a cover on one . if it is to keep the beverage warm or cool longer , i do not believe it is necessary . the double walls with the vacuum between does a good job of maintaining the temperatures . i would be careful about taking the glasses in the car or other places since they do shatter when hit or dropped . 
the filter is designed to be washed and used again . no disposable filters . 
i 've only had this unit since july and it is operating perfectly . i have another one of the same model that i 've had for more than one year and it 's still working perfectly without changing the ion plate . great product ! 
there are two dials on the front of the machine . one dial is for the ozone option , the other for the regular air cleaning option . if you do n't want the ozone option , do n't turn the ozone dial on . each dial has a definite clicking sound alerting you that you have turned it on or off . only the ozone option uses a plate ( 2 of them ) inserted in the rear of the machine that creates ozone . you have the option of inserting one or both plates . you will have to experiment once you purchase the machine whether you will need both or not . everything depends upon how bad the odors are you are trying to remove . the fan in the machine is very powerful . you can adjust the strength of the fan and ozone output by turning the dials . 
yes it will 
do n't really have an exact answer to that , but it does put out a good bit and that 's the `` rain fresh '' smell we like that it puts out . we typically put the ozone control on low when we leave the house and turn it off when we return home . even on the low setting the entire house smells very fresh and after turning off the ozone , we leave the ionizer on med fan speed 24 7. hopes this helps you : ) 
no 
the bottle does come with a glass that fits nicely on top . additionally , there is a very slight reservoir on the top that catches any residual water from the glass , keeping it off the table . very clever ! 
it is one bottle with a top . 
it could , i never thought of using it for that purpose . it is a lovely piece . 
yes . i use mine to store mouthwash in my bathroom . i have run it through the dishwasher many time . it 's just glass and its pretty sturdy too . 
it holds 28 ounces . 
i 'm not sure , but what i can tell you is that is nice for $ 15 not $ 40 ... 
the primary difference ( and advantage ) is the 1385 's larger boiler , 64oz verses the 48oz of the 1375. the amount of water boiling determines the steady flow of steam you get . so while either model will operate at 4 bar 58psi , you can run steadily at a higher pressure with the boiler of larger capacity . in addition , the 1385 has 23 vs 20 accessories , for what that 's worth . be sure to visit mcculloch 's website , it 's easy to compare specs of all their models . 
the handle does contain a a + and - valve like wheel , you can adjust the volume of steam coming from the nozzle and it seems to add a slight pressure when turned up . it does not however apply pure pressure . its a great steamer however does not work well at all on heavy greased areas such as on or around vehicles . 
yes it comes with a straight nozzle with a brass tip you can add to the nozzle which cleans grout amazingly ! 
try ebay 
heat and alcohol kill bed bugs , so this should work . good quality mattress encasements are essential and then a product called sterifab http : www.sterifab.com q % 26a.html sprayed on all cracks and crevices . the heat in this device should work as well . 
yes , each attachment will utilize the wand . using the mop pad is just part of another attachment . 
greater then 212 degrees fahrenheit . the unit essentially boils water under pressure . 
no . it does n't works on carpets . 
dusty is a decent size for a sheet cake . about 5-5 1 2 `` across the wings and the body about 6 '' long . it comes with a plastic `` dish '' it sits in on the cake . it made a really cute cake decoration . and it 's something the child can keep . 
yes , with the other piece showing a picture of two planes . 
cooking surface 11 '' x 15 '' overall size 14 '' x 21-1 4 '' 
yep ! 
it does not have a warming tray , it has a drip pan to catch drips . 
no it does not , but do n't let that deter you from this purchase ... the health benifits far out weigh the non ceramic grill and griddles out there ! ! ! 
no 
yes 
a little on the slow side , but be patient and gentle and treat it nice and it does a good job . not recommended that you use it on real high heat if you want it to last . 
`` all of our air purifiers have been tested to comply within the ozone safety requirements set forth by california air resources board . our biogs model emits zero ozone when the negative ion generator is on or off and our minusa2 emits zero ozone on all speeds once you have turned off the negative ion generator . an amount of 0.002 ppm ( parts-per-million ) was recorded at low fan speed of our minusa2 with the negative ionizer turned on . that is 25 times less than the 0.05 ppm maximum ozone concentration safety standard set forth by the california air resources board .

hi gail , thank you for your question . an interesting fact about hepa filters are that they were initially designed to prevent the spread of airborne radiation during world war ii . that being said , unfortunately , we do not know to what degree the filters will trap the radiation particles as environment and degree of particulates in the air are usually unknown without prior testing . we hope that this shed some light for you , and if you have any other questions , please feel free to contact us again . kind regards , rabbit air customer care team 
i just checked the underside and found out that it 's made in korea . 
no . it 's not designed for large particulates . it may help with the very fine dust you may get while working with wood . 
we own the latte cups , same material , same manufacturer as these dishes . they will be microwave safe because it is not real gold . real gold trim will spark in microwave . these are safe . 
hi , jude , there were 2 sets of cereal bowls on ebay . i bought one . there is a set from 222 fifth called eliza that would mix well with this . amazon should have it . macy 's had a set of the eliza mixed with peacock salad plates and eliza cereal bowls . good luck to you . rochelle 
yes , they are beautiful they match every blue dish l have because of the multi blues on the peacock .

unfortunately it will not . the extension cord that comes with it is a very heavy duty line . i would recommend buying an american-european cord convert on amazon . that should do the trick . you could also contact a sales rep from pro team but they do not have any conversion kits on their site . 
it only sucks doent blow 
nancy the bags are disposable but i am sure you can empty them a few times . you need to make sure you use real proteam bags to protect dirt and dust from damaging the motor . mike kline - home delivered 
hello , thanks for your question . according to the information in the product description section of the product page , the package includes the following attachments : 14 '' xover multi-surface floor tool , 17 '' crevice tool , 3 '' dust brush , 5 '' upholstery tool . 1 '' static-dissipating vacuum hose , 1.5 '' telescoping wand , 50 ' extension cord and two intercept micro filter bags . have a great day ! 
i have no doubt it will . i have cut-pile frieze type carpet in my home . i use a top-of-the line kenmore upright for spot vacuuming and the backpack unit for a whole house vacuum job . the upright has a revolving brush and the proteam does not ; however , the proteam does just as well as the upright but quicker . 
not supposed to use it in a regular oven only a microwave 
no , it 's completely lead free . you would n't be able to microwave it otherwise . : ) 
yes . but be aware the $ 10 is for one stonewave , not two . i received mine very promptly through amazon , but i 've not yet used it . 
1 4 teaspoon of water in the cooker . crack an egg into the cooker add salt & pepper to taste . put lid on and microwave for 20 seconds . leave it in the microwave and wait another 20 sec to let it set . cook again for 20 more seconds and remove from microwave . if you want cheese , sprinkle finely shredded cheese on top as soon as its done . place lid back on for 45 seconds and the cheese will melt nicely . no need to place it back in the microwave 
it is actuly kinda small , just right for a single person . i put in 3 eggs for an omlet that fluffs up to the rim . i woud think they should come out with other sizes . but if you order more than one you probly wont be disappointed . in one review it said the hadle gets hot but mine dosnt at all . have a great day i hope it works out for you . 
yes , select a potatoe to fit the wave , make a slice about 1 8 to 1 4 deep across the top of the potatoe , add a tablespoon of water , cook in micro-wave starting at two minutes , test for doneness , if two minutes does'nt suit then cook in increments of one minute . you will soon find out how long to cook to satisfaction . when through cooking press potatoe open and serve with butter and sour cream if desired right in the wave . bon appetite 
time to cook 2 eggs is 1 1 2 minutes 
the comforter is on the bed in the guest bedroom and i have n't had any complaints . 
i would n't expose it to open flame , but perhaps if you put aluminum foil under it . 
this product is manufactured in china and is made of 100 % fda approved materials , including a high quality fiberglass core and food grade silicone . 
this silicone baking mat measures 11 5 8 x 16 1 2 inches . one mat is included and it fits a half size baking sheet perfectly . 
the answer is neither . this hose connects to an air driven power head , vice an electric driven head , so there is no 110 volt connection . the only electrical connection in this hose is a low voltage fitting in the wall connector to start the central vac unit . hope this helps ... 
yes we do . 
yes 
no it wo n't . it is a low voltage system and you will need an 120 volt . 
the caps can be used over and over again . it works really well .

i measured one for you it 's 13 '' height 13.5 wide 
the lid is stainless , nice quality . i bought it for a de buyer 14 '' frying pan ( 2nd try ) . the lid did not fit without a little modification . i used a belt sander to remove a little from the rim at the location of each handle . it now fits perfectly . this is a large lid , make sure you have a place to store it when not in use . 
dear s.b . cleary , thank you for your inquiry . this is a 14 inch lid so , so it should fit a 14 skillet . to get the proper fit of lid we suggest that you measure from rim to rim and round it to the nearest inch . thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . sincerely , tonia d . 
dear shuling , thank you for your interest in the circulon product line . our products are made in our oversees factories , either thailand or china . thank you for allowing me to be of service to you . kind regards , audrey consumer relations

dear seema soni , thank you for your inquiry . the 14 inch wok lid weighs approximately 2 pounds . i hope you find this information helpful . thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . regards , susie consumer relations 
hello amazon consumer , yes that item is stainless steel , however the gauge i do not have available . i have inquired and will be able to provide you with an answer within 24 to 48 hours . thank you for allowing me to be of service to you . sincerely , audrey consumer relations 
hi . not if you have proper ventilation . i always set mine on the stove right under the exhaust fan and have the window on the other end of my home open just a little so there is a path for the air to flow to the fan . this works for meat that is not real fatty . now if you are cooking burgers or brats it 's a good idea to also have a fan pointing outward in a window next to the grill to take care of the extra smoke . this is a great grill . i have tried three or four different kinds after they banned gas grilling on balconies and the others were terrible . this one cooks great food and is very easy to clean .

no . it is 110 
i really have no idea , but for me it does n't matter . i was completely surprised by the quality . this is by far the best bed set i have ever bought . it 's soft , warm but not bulky . i totally love it . 
it 's not heavy at all but if you use it to cover up its very warm . 
hi haddy , thank you for your question . yes , our android app is currently being developed and we anticipate it 's release sometime in the first quarter of 2014 . -vitagoods 
i do n't know . i have an android phone . 
yes , the weights come into the app and you apply them to the proper user , then on futures weigh ins the scale associates the weight with the right user on its own 
no it is not . only with their own vitasigns application . but i hear health kit integration is coming in 2015 
not really . sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt . its a great scale overall though . 
hi , unfortunately this is not compatible with the fitbit system ; however , please note there is a manual upload for any entries you would like to add one at a time . 
hi simon , thank you for your question . unfortunately , at this time we do not have a pc version of our app but is something we hope to have in the future . our app is currently compatible with an iphone , ipad or ipod touch . i hope that helps answer your question ! 
you can add if you have them ; they come out easily ( and go back in easily too : - ) ) . it depends on what you are going to hang and how much space is going to take . 
the width of your cabinet needs to be 2 '' wider than the width of your largest pan . so , for example , if your largest skillet is 12 '' , the opening of the cabinet should be 14 '' . this will give you 1 '' clear space on either side of the pan when glideware is extended . 
yes cco9 , contact me for shipping charge 
the answer has been provided in the description : 15 pairs `` standard , '' 3 pairs per shelf . but keep in mind that the depth can only accommodate size 9 max , so for shoes larger than 9 , you 'd need to store them side way , but would take up more space . also , you would be able to fit more ladies ' dress shoes .

transparent 
headboard is 31.5 '' tall and footboard is 14 '' tall . i got the mattress that was recommended to come with it and that seems to work well also . 
the headboard height is 31.5 inches max size ( measured on the outside of the frame ) the width is 64 , the length is 83.5 i ordered a queen and ordered the following mattress which they recommended . fit perfectly http : www.amazon.com gp product b005a4on90 ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 
http : www.amazon.com gp product b005a4on90 ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 we got a queen memory foam that was recommended to go with the queen headboard . it works fine . 
yes 
well they fit fine over a ddbl bed with pad if anything i guess they wood fit a extera high profile matt 
yes it is polyester . however , they are still extremely soft and comfortable . i was shocked and pleased at the same time . 
they are egyptian cotten . super soft ! 
they should be listed as polyester ... ... .. 
hi everett , our greek yogurt makers come wiith 2 bpa free plastic containers which holds about 7 cups each . you would use one at a time and have the ability to use the second container to start a new batch right away if you wish . i hope this answers your question ! 
yes , it goes to 24 hours and then back to 30 minutes 
you can use homemade yogurt as starter for another batch . i save the whey to use for breadmaking , and have found that i can use about 1 4 cup whey as starter for a new yogurt batch , so i do n't have to worry about saving some yogurt to use as a starter . the whey alone works great ! 
i measure 5 cups of milk to make a batch . this amount is slightly more than the white strainer container can strain immediately however after a few minutes the extra fits . or just start with 4 1 2 cups to ensure the strainer fits all . this is a great yogurt maker that i have been using 3-4 times a week . remember the volume reduces greatly but homemade is so nice . enjoy . 
no ! you can make an almond milk yogurt , but you must use almonds that have been grounded up and soaked . store bought `` almond milk '' has other ingredients in it . 
the ceo of dash company says the following . `` the unit is also made from 100 % bpa-free plastic . '' on the bottom of the dash plastic containers is a recycle symbol with the letters pp underneath . i have researched and this is the result -- -plastic # 5 - pp ( polypropylene ) *increasingly becoming accepted by curbside recycle programs , plastic # 5 is also one of the safer plastics to look for . *it is typically found in yogurt containers , ketchup bottles , syrup bottles , and medicine bottles . hope this helps . 
i do n't see why not . it just keeps it at the right temperature . but if you are making greek yogurt you will only get about 2.5 cups of yogurt after you filter off the whey from 5 cups of milk . 
i have used this on wine bottles . and i do n't know why you could n't use it for carbonated beverages . but i found it hard to use because you have to pump it for a long time . i have used the other wine vacuum sealers . such as - http : www.amazon.com vacu-vin-3-piece-saver-stopper dp b00004saf4 ref=sr_1_16 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1381160966 & sr=8-16 & keywords=wine+vacuum+sealer 
hello , this is directly out of the manual under components and features . `` made of high-quality , heavy-gauge , stainless steel , all cooking takes place in the pressure cooker pot . '' and on the bottom of the pot is says inox-stainless steel . hope this helps . 
yes 
hand washing only is recommended for this unit . i have never really had a problem keeping mine clean . 
the cayenne pressure cooker by fagor is made in spain . karen eurostoves 
i believe the difference is color and the handle . i like this handle better . 
it 's a large stainless basket with a handle . being that the pot is 8 qt , i would estimate the basket at a minimum of 4 qt . 
11 3 8 '' diameter , 15 '' from handle tip to handle tip , and 4 '' tall . 
11-1 2 x 4 tall and 5 qt . i love it . i have the 8 qt that 's much deeper for soups and stews . i was a leery that it would be too shallow but it is perfect for on top of stove and the oven for other things . 
yes . the lid is made from tempered glass and can withstand 500 we use this one at least 4 times a week ! 
no . they are made with hard carbon steel covered by a non-stick coating . i have had these knives for over six months and i cook a lot . these are my favorite knives of all time ! ! ! 
i do n't know . i gave them as a gift . i have another brand that i use daily and have n't had to sharpen them yet . 
i 'm sorry , i ca n't answer the question . i do n't know . i bought kenmore o bags for the kenmore progressive . 
sure is , works perfectly . 
i 've measured it flat and it came out 6 '' wide by 17 1 2 '' long . the canadian part number is : 20-50510 and us part number is 20-50690. it 's the exact same box of 2 you 'd find in a sears store . 
it is 13 '' tall ( not including the feet levelers , 24 '' wide , 17 & 7 8 ( almost 18 '' front to back . 
the specifications show , width 17.1 '' depth 18.9 '' height 11.5 '' 
i like it very much ! easy to use and clean . definitely recommend it if you are looking for a large microwave . 
winbot uses a motor to generate suction , that is how it stays on the window . if you use winbot on a window above ground level , there is a safety pod to attach for added safety . 
the adaptor is 100 - 240v ~ 50 60hz 1.6a 
it requires your window to have a minimum size and it is only design for glass cleaning , so i do n't think it can help you . on top , this machine has serious reliability issue and is not comparable to a robot vacuum cleaner . my advice is do n't buy it at all 
i 'm near the water , but do n't have actual salt on the windows . but they were awfully dirty . i 'm talking dirt , spiderwebs , the lot . and the winbot got them clean , although it took a couple of passes . you might have to wipe a spot to get it to stick when you put it on . mostly it goes forward , so the wet pad will get to the dirt and salt before the suction pads . it does occasionally back over a dirty spot , though , so salt crystals might not be the best thing for the pads . 
winbot should not be used in temperatures below 40 degrees f or if it is raining ( or snowing , of course ! ) . 
winbot is square so it works best on square shaped windows . having said that , it can clean a trapezoidal shaped window but it will not be able to fit into the corners . 
i use 2 scoops for 1 large cup of coffee . i also use the turkish grind from starbucks . 
the information provided on the site says it is a medium weight comforter . it is plenty warm for me . i would not want anything heavier . my only problem is that , as a king size , it does not fit in my washer so i will have to take it to a commercial laundry . 
i have not used bleach . i suggest you check with the maker of the comforter . 
i do n't know as i purchased the king size which was described as being 90 '' wide x 106 '' long . i do love the comforter . 
it is 90 '' x90 '' , so you could measure your bed and see where it will fall . with ours , it comes just down to the skirt . i wanted that size because we have a harmonizing green skirt and they look nice together . it actually goes far enough towards the headboard to cover pillows and you would n't need the matching pillow shams , but they come in the package and look good on top . 
it is square , 90 '' x 90 '' 
polyester cotton blend . made in china . nice quality . 
yep , queen size came with two pillow shams . love the set . 
this quilt is pretty sturdy ... i 've had it for months now through several washings , and it is the same soft , strongly stitched quilt . i think it would hold up to a small dog just fine . 
no , it 's does n't lock . the tank part on top lifts up off the bottom part , just like most humidifiers . 
no , but i can run from 8p to 8a on one tank . 
http : www.amazon.com gp product b00fpyc5mw stock should be updated within an hour . thanks ! 
hello daniel , i 'm afraid i do n't know of any other place where you can purchase consumer quantities of just the lid . if you would like one of these lids un-drilled i 'm sure we can accommodate you . if you decide to order , please just add a comment to your order requesting it be `` un-drilled '' . 
we are very happy with our malouf sheets . there was no discernable shrinkage after several washings . you should know a few things about our household and laundry demands in order to put our experiences compared to your particular demands . i assume that mattresss thickness is the root of your question about shrinkage . it 's not a big issue with us since we no longer purchase the very thick matresses which for us were not any better than those 7-9 incles thick . a good comfortable mattress is not determined by adding thickness in most cases . especially in these days of memory foam and the prevailent use of latex now , in our experience . we did not see unacceptable shrinkage in the pillow cases though . we washed the sheets before the first use . we use the new `` steam '' setting in our washer to get rid of most impurities when we wash the sheets . that gets pretty hot and we usually use that setting . our sheets are dried whenever weather permits on an outside clothesline to enjoy the fresh , cool finish on our sheets . there is no other way to achieve this effect , but the sheets have been machine-dried a lot this season because of frequent rain . one way or the other , our sheets are still like new . we buy only all cotton percale sheets so our efforts are justly rewarded . these sheets did live up to our expectations and we could not be happier with our choice . we hope this helps and good luck to you . 
it 's all cotton . 
yes . it will accommodate a mattress up to 18 '' deep . 
no ... .not listed on tag . 
it is over the door and you have the option of screwing it to the door also . i hung it on the door and used command metal hooks no . 17067-vp to fasten it on the sides to keep it from moving . 
there are three `` track '' sections , which means it can be setup as 1 , 2 , or 3 units . however , there is only one set ( 2 ) brackets that hang over a door . this means wood screws would be used in place of the brackets . 
sadly no . the unit is 18 inches wide . 
do n't quite understand your question ... i have it hung on the inside of my pantry door ... screwed into the door ... though a person can use the hangers to just hang it ... .i wanted it firm against the door and not flopping ... you could use it on either side of the door ... your choice . 
glass panels are attached . does n't look to me like you could remove them . 
it is actually a dark brown metal , meant to look antique . it comes in a few pieces which you put together bu can leave off and keep only the knobs . however the mounting holes are visible but not too much . 
laminate over manufactured wood . 
you can not stain this piece as it is not a real wood surface , but vinyl . with a good primer you may have some luck painting it . 
32.5 '' high , 19 '' deep , 70 '' wide 
33 '' 
sure ... there are no pre-drilled holes for the doors ( and they mount from the `` inside '' ) 
i found that it had a rather strong chemical smell for a few days . it would be best to air it out . 
it is the most comfortable thing i have ever had , is sooth and cool so love it . i would recommend it to anyone . my old mattress was not quite ready to be thrown so this adds to the comfort and is terrific . i had one in the past years but had to give it away when i moved . this is every bit as nice and do love it . i got the 4 inch and it is just right . 
no 
hello and in response to your question it is a queen size mattress 
thank you for your question . this item does not have a zip off . the size is for a twin , full and queen . we will be posting the king now as well for a higher price . 
this is an oil free fryer . i would say 2 quarts of food , for example , 2 dozens of wings and or 4 cups of fries ; it depends on what you are frying . i have to say that the wings and the fries ( from scratch ) come out golden and crispy , just the way i like them . 
it is not the weight so much as the bulk . the bottom of the screened basket is about 7 '' x 7 1 2 '' . so anything such as fish , steaks , etc . will have to fit within that space . of course the cooking time will vary depending on how thick the pieces are . the cooking times and temperatures vary and i noticed that the skimpy book that came with it and the times on the front of the cooker are not the same . i am very happy with mine ... but it does take a few uses to learn what works best . the one thing i do like is that the food is not moved around with a paddle which knocks off any coating that you use . also , i would not recommend this one for family sized meals as it is too small . for one or two , it is great and so easy to clean . 
i turn it up to 400 f and it takes about l7 mins . that of course depends on how full the basket is . i also stir them with a spatula half way through . yam fries are also great and some of the small potatoes quartered are wonderful as well . what i do is to put the potatoes into a plastic bag , drizzle olive oil and a bit a balsamic vinegar and sprinkle with spices before cooking . enjoy . 
no , its a fryer and the down part is empty , hollow , and the oil exude to external box as in a conventional fryer . 
you see , nothing non fried will ever taste as great as something fried , but things cooked in this device are pretty good . frozen fries are almost as good . what i like the most is that it 's simpler than frying , and after a while using the machine it even gets faster . 
you would need a robust step down transformer to convert 220v to 110-120v . read the specifications for the fryer , it may require around 1000w so your transformer must have at least that much if not 2-3x more . 
this is an oil free 'fryer ' so it 's basically a convection oven with a basket .

no extra shelves 
i ca n't remember exact height but width-wise , no . the horizontal parts would be too wide . 
yes 
this clamps onto your closet rod and it takes up 26 '' . i hope this helps . i love them . i have two ! 
it is quite sturdy . i own 2 of these . most of your close hang on the actual closet rod itself . only the lower rod on the closet rod organizer can hold many pairs of pant or skirts . i currently have 26 pairs of pants hanging from this rod . i would definitely recommend and if i needed more of these , i would n't hesitate to purchase more . 
i ca n't remember exactly but if you go to the sleep innovations website you will find all of the information listed . at one time i believe amazon had a comparison chart also , but if they no longer do , go to the manufacturer 's website . i love this mattress , i think you will be very satisfied with it . 
i 've just taken a tape measure to mine . it is 11 1 2 . 
this item will be shipped from california 's warehouse . 
several minutes if you continuously press the button . it does n't take much to make the mist work well . my 5yr old had it most of the time and he definitely misted anything and everything within reaching distance for hours ! 
yes , you have to give it a few pumps . 
they came together in one package . so 2 in 1 box . 
it has a carabineer for easy carrying . 
i do n't think it would hurt it at all . 
very subjective , but i 'd say it 's closer to the `` virtually silent '' end rather than `` really noisy . '' it 's not loud at all . 
the bottle holds 10 oz of water . the mist will last approximately 10 minutes of continuous mist ( exclude time to pump multiple times ) , but normally no one uses it like that . the mist lasts up to 1.5 hours of intermittent use between refills . 
yes , this table has some matching chairs that are exactly the same finish and color : http : www.amazon.com gp product b00djv53w2 http : www.amazon.com gp product b00djw7oza http : www.amazon.com gp product b00djwfdoo http : www.amazon.com gp product b00djynmrc http : www.amazon.com gp product b00djyuuzo http : www.amazon.com gp product b00dh4c3n8 also this small bistro table is from the same collection : http : www.amazon.com gp product b00dh7iaak hope this helps 
closed 35.5 '' wide , 25.5 '' deep . open 51 '' wide , 35.5 '' deep . hope this helps , it 's a beautiful table . 
i ordered this beautiful table after reading some of the reviews , a bit pricey but well worth it and yes it is very sturdy.. 
there are no matching stools . there are matching chairs that are available , please let me know if you need links to them . 
front of the table has a 29.5 distance between the legs . at the side the distance is 18.25 '' hope that helps , edgar 
yes 
particle board top with wood sides , painted black . it is fairly sturdy ! 
dimensions are 15-3 4 '' d x 23-1 2 '' w x 5 '' h 
roughly 22 inches from inside edge to inside edge . 
no . 
hi ... hopefully i wo n't confuse you . i measured both outside the boards and inside . the outside measured 23.5 '' wide , 5.5 '' tall and a little more than 15 '' from front to back ... inside : about 4.5 '' from the brace inside to the table surface ... ( add 1-1.5 '' ) if you do n't need more than say 7 '' of your underneath or the unit you place under is small enough to clear the bracing bar . hope this helps ... : ) my blue ray player is small enough it fits under with a lot of room to spare . ( the inside width measured about 22.5 '' ) 
16 inches

hi m. brady , the hourglass does stand on its own . thanks , customer service team 
the height of the hourglass is 11.5 inches , and the width at the largest area is 4 inches . hope that helps : ) 
the 8 '' pan weighs about 1.25 lbs , the 10 '' pan weighs almost 2 lbs 
i am not sure about the handles . otherwise , they promise , it is sure . i use it on the stove top , and more than happy with it . love it ! 
yes , we love it ! ! 
i have had very good luck with these pans . and use the more than any of my other pans . 
my understanding is that they are . i have not used mine in the oven yet , but would not hesitate to do so . 
no 
not happy with what i received.. 
its made of polyester not actual micro-suede , it just feels like it . polyester is machine washable . i would recommend light wash in cold water to prevent any color running . also you might want to was the sheets separately from the comforter . 
yes with room to spare 
made in china . 
your question is best answered by calling vacmaster tech support at 1-800-821-7849 . 
no , i bought mine separately . it does come with the connection for it though and an assortment of bags . 
sorry , we just got ours and have n't tried anything but regular bags . 
yes this machine can seal canning jars . mine came with hose port for doing that . enjoy the machine . 
yes- the heat time is adjustable so it works with many different bags . you do need to practice a little to find the correct setting . one hint , start low and move up . if the setting is too high the plastic melts and sticks to the heat strip . not good , and difficult to clean . 
the vicmaster pro305 i have is 15 '' wide , 12 '' deep , and 5 '' high . the power cord plugs into the right side so allow another 2 '' ( approximately ) . hope this is helpful . 
it include 30 assorted bags , accessory hose for canisters and a maintenance kit . thanks . 
yes , this will work with foodsaver bags . you will save a lot of money by using foodvacbags or vacmaster bags , though . they are much less expensive . 
thank you for your inquiry . this is plug in option . however , you can purchase hardwired connection as well , it is sold separately . kind regards ! 
artur , the new 2014 models have a hardwiring kit already inside of the package . however , if you have an older version that requires a hardwiring it , i 'd recommend you to contact the manufacturer directly : virtu usa . they 'll be able to assist you . bath center 
thank you for your inquiry . this item is manufactured in china . 
thank you for your inquiry . the overall height is 27.3 inches and the seat height is 16.5 inches . 
thank you for your inquiry . the weight capacity is 120 kgs , or roughly 265 pounds . 
yes , the drawer front folds down for keyboard use . 
it is fantastic on all uncooked vegetables . it is the first knife i reach for both meat as well as veges but not frozen stuff . 
you should never dishwash a knife , even a crummy one , even a steel one . the high pressure jets of water rattle blades around . even with steel , it dulls the blade and makes microscopic chips . this ruins a steel knife , ( whether the average user notices it or not ) a ceramic blade is harder and even more brittle than a steel blade . do not dishwash knives . becase ceramic is even more non porus and nonreactive than steel is , all you have to do is run it under soap and water and dry it . 
the manufacturer advises not to twist or torque the blade . also warns about not using it to smash a clove of garlic on a cutting board . since this is ceramic , it requires a bit more caution , but it does slice and chop terrifically . 
no . the blade is solid cermamic . 
no and that is one down point of this product . i wished to have a sheath for this knife . 
i have done extensive research on this and have found no country of origin for the manufacture of this knife . the company is based in oakland california and only markets two products ; this knife and a scale . that being said , the quality of the knife is good , it is lightweight and very sharp . it is my go to knife for slicing and dicing veggies and mushrooms . i have had it for about 6 months and with the proper care it has held up just fine . 
no sheath provided , when you buy the knife it will give you directions on how to store i put my in wood knife block . 
the total length of the knife is twelve ( 12 ) inches and the blade length is eight ( 8 ) inches . 
no . you press the button and it starts . you press the button again and it stops . it 's not at all a problem because you 're making espresso -- it 's not like it takes long to make ! 
i purchased the coffee duck refillable pods , and they worked marginally but made extremely weak coffee with no crema ( the espresso foam ) on top . we were so bummed ! we have a custom grinder and played around with setting it to super fine , medium fine , etc . and nothing seemed to help . we tried packing the pods tight , leaving a little room , etc . and still the coffee sucked . stick with the capsules ; they 're expensive up front , but worth it in the end . plus , nespresso 's capsules are rainforest-alliance certified , which is the highest certification for both sustainability and fair-trade . you can also recycle your pods now by turning them into sur la table . hope that helps ! 
with the manual , you egress the button to both start and stop the brew . one the plus side , you control how tall or short your cup is . on the downside , you ca n't walk away or get distracted . i have both types of machines , one at home and one at work . i feel like the difference in quality is negligible when the price is compared . i do seem to have trouble getting up enough pressure to pierce the capsules on my manual sometimes . if you 're on a budget , the manual is fine and makes great espresso ! 
110v 
it 's not much . maybe 3-4 pounds ? 
it would core it while it spiral sliced and peeled it . i think that would be a waste of a lot of zucchini since it does n't need to be cored ! there 's no way to avoid coring 
i just checked mine , and on mine the blade that slices is adjustable . it can be moved out of the way , so that you only peel and core . you will always core , the coring is part of the frame . so if you did a potato , it would core it . we make sliced apples ( similar to famous dave 's apples ) all the time using this , and it works awesome . can core , peel , and slice a full apple in about 10 to 15 seconds . 
yes , it will core and slice without peeling . 
no . not since i 've been using it . 
no i do n't think you can . 
no . or at least i have n't figured out how to do so . 
i have not , but would be very interested in same information . 
this lid fits a standard regular mouth jar . standard canning jars are available in regular and wide mouth . 
height : 5 1 8 '' inside to lip ; 7 '' to top of plunger assembly . i would not use the teapot in the microwave to heat the water to brewing temp as i am not sure how it would react . 
it is plastic ! 
according to instruction manual there is a 3 yr factory warranty i have had a new one that lasted for 10 yrs with everyday use and a rebuilt one that lasted around 5 yrs . hope this helps 
its like a fan on low but works awesome its our second one the first one lasted 22 years 
we did not keep this air purifier . we have a living air clasic xl15 . we wash the filters for our purifier but i do n't know about the alpine air . 
first of all , let me tell you we did not keep this unit-it produced too much ozone for us and it was really noisy . we already had a living air classic xl15 and we decided since we liked it so much and it did such a good job , we would have it repaired . the unit is 8 '' wide x 11.75 '' high x 9.75 '' deep . i do know that the filter on our unit is washable . hope this helps . 
27 3 8 inches 
do n't remeber exactly , but not more than about 20 lbs-it is easily lfted and set up by one person . 
yes . it works great for making almond milk . much better than the cheese cloth i was using 
yes and it works great 
there is a link on the paperwork that comes with the bag that gives you the e-book . it is quite easy and there are tons of recipes on the web as well . 
no 
quite a few . my guess as someone who has one that it is about 10 cups probably . it is good sized . 
i do n't know about soy bean milk but have used it to strain hot soup and make coconut milk using dried coconut and very hot water . you just had to be careful to let the bag cool before trying to squeeze it . ouch . 
it is made in china . 
that 's what i bought this for , and it works great ! 
i would use a strainer to remove the kefir grains rather than a nut bag 
i bought two packages of the silver ones . one was not enough . i think each package had 24. ibhad about 8 to ten left over . 
you will need 3 packages of 12. i can not remember exactly but i believe it used 32 or 34 . 
after mine hugh for a week or two the folds all came out . 
metrokane who also makes the `` rabbit `` wine opener , makes a very nice but expensive wine decanter . this wine aerator is one of the easiest and cheapest to use . just place it in the bottle after you have opened it and pour through it when you pour glasses of wine and when you are finished , it is very easy to clean under the faucet . it also fits in the drawer because it is n't very big . i think it works very well and i would recommend this wine aerator to anyone . 
i have n't tried it on that size but since it is tapered i assume it would fit . you can find out for sure from susan at `` b.h.p . - amazon marketplace '' & lt ; ykd4q917s5h4pp9 @ marketplace.amazon.com & gt ; they have been great - one of the best online retailers i have ever dealt with ! 
not sure , the wine i had did n't have any sediment . however , the bubbles after the aeration were very fine , so it is logical to assume that some particles may be filtered out , especially larger ones . 
it is made of a very thick plastic to ensure it doesnt break very easy ! 
i do n't know . perhaps you should ask the seller ?

as per the description replacement carafe * fits models 49980 , 49980z , 49983 , 49984c iption 
yes it is a 12 cup carafe and works great 
yes , it 's exactly like the original . 
sorry , that 's not the model i have so i 'd only be guessing 
i have this in my living room and it is actually quiter than the 800 sq foot one i have in my bedroom . though to be honest i would get one of the smaller ones that are much cheaper for your bedroom . this unit puts off surprisingly little heat considering it claims to be for 2000 sq feet , i hear good things about the dr. infrared heater 1500 sq ft one , but i do n't own one of those so i ca n't personally attest to it . 
yes it does 
18 inches high , 15 inches deep , 14 inches wide 
it would take about 6-8 hours to reach desire temp on high setting 
no it is too heavy . 
hello there ! this model comes with a one year manufacturer warranty . 
hello there ! this heater is a 1500w model and therefore , it is about 5000 btu hr . 
nope . just the foam . 
ask the company you are getting it from 
i ca n't say for sure , but with this foam not having a cloth cover , it stays in one place much better than those with a cover ( a prior experience ) , ... so my guess is that it would stay where you put it . if not , you could purchase the thin , non-skid , flexible meshes , often used under small scatter rugs , and the foam would more than likely , stay in one place . 
we have no idea . we bought a queen size . 
i do n't think so . i put the foam on right away ... only leaving it until that night to sleep on . the odor was slight..at least to me . i did not receive any instructions on waiting . 
ca n't you guess ? china , of course , is n't everything ? i 've had no problems with it . 
it takes about 10 mins from cold to roaring boil . 
yes , it writes on the case . 
slowly 
no you ca n't 
it will touch the window which is a plastic part . 
fits fine for me . it is a nice little box . 
approximately w3.5 '' x l3.5 '' x h2.75 '' 
approximately w3.5 '' x l3.5 '' x h2.75 '' 
this unit evaporates the condensation it creates i live in a tiny condo with only one slide sideways window , the humidity and heat is crazy . this unit is care free , very affordable , and easy on the electric bill 
it is loud , but not obnoxiously loud , just have to turn the t.v . volume up a little . there is a quiet mode but it 's not any quieter then the other modes . totally worth it though , it cools off our rooms quickly and very easy to move from room to room . 
yes , our windows is sideways , you need duck tape and thick card board to fill in the gap . 
i just purchased this unit about 2 months ago and i have n't had to empty it once ! i opened it up last night to check again and not 1 drop . i leave it on 67 almost all day long ! some runs have been over 24 hours and not a drop . i live in southern california and i have a friend with this unit in arizona and he said he has to empty his about once a month so it probably depends on the humidity . 
well it 's adjustable to fit almost any window . if it does n't you can cut the plastic down to 12 '' as long as you can fit the exhaust which is about 10 '' long by 3 '' high out the window . 
it expands to fit whatever width your window happens to be . it is not airtight , though . i put some foam to make it more so . hope this helps . 
the point in the hose is to close up the house from infiltration of heated outside air . the hose fits to the vinyl closer for either a door or window that allows that to happen . if you were to simply put the unit in front of a door and run it , it would be like leaving the door to your refrigerator open all the time - it would put some cold air into the fridge , but would be horribly inefficient . hope that answers your question . 
yep . a small remote with all the functions . 
8 '' 
no . 
it does not come with pillows 
all mattress sizes are standard dimensions : twin = 39 '' w x 75 '' l , twin-xl = 39 '' w x 80 '' l , full = 54 '' w x 75 '' l , & queen = 60 '' w x 80 '' l . 
plastic . 
i have not . but , i am using dr. bronner 's pure castile soap - lavender . i would like to know the answer as well since i like to add essential oils to my soap . 
sorry julie i don`t know but if you don`t eat or drink from containers that contain bpa you can`t be hurt . 
yes ... add no water if you use pre-mixed foaming soap 
i do n't know , but you can put your desired number of dispensers in the shopping cart , go through checkout until the next-to-last step , and see the shipping cost before clicking on `` order . '' if the total shipping cost is too high , i would empty the cart , google the product , and look elsewhere for a better deal . 
no you will not ! there are replacement battery packs you can get , even here on amazon . i own a dc44 and the battery pack is a 6 cell 2000 mah battery from factory , so if you get one aftermarket you have to get at least 2000mah or you will have less run time if you do n't . they will have replacements for this model as well as soon as they update their products . i do n't know the spec on the dc59 though . ******edit***** 2 18 14 i now own a dc59 animal and what a difference in suction ! ! ! way better . the battery has 2100 mah battery pack and is now held in place by small screw . but still easy to replace and yes dyson sells them for around $ 70 each and a charger for about $ 30 
actually,110-240v.all dyson cordless cleaners is ok from 110v to 240v . 
see my review -- the charge does not last 26 minutes under any circumstances . they say `` 26 minutes '' because they include the time you 'll be carrying the vacuum around without pressing the trigger ( yes , seriously ) . on the non-max setting , you can expect 20 minutes if you do n't use the motorized attachments , and 17 if you do . on max it 's 6 minutes ( not sure if that 's the same with or without the attachments ) . 
i think the difference between the dc59 animal and the dc58 non-animal ( i do n't believe there is a non-animal dc59 ) is the attachments . the dc59 comes with the long floor attachment to allow the vacuum to be used as a full length floor vacuum ( along with a bigger carpet attachment ) along with several other upholstery and a ceiling fan attachment . the dc58 just comes with the regular attachments but does n't have the long tube to extend or any of the powered attachments . so basically you 're paying extra to be able to use this handheld like a full size and have several attachments designed to get pet hair ( and other stuff ) off the couch cushions and the stairs and the ceiling fan . . . 
yes 
i 've never timed it with precision , but i think it 's about 3 hours .

hi there . thank you for asking this question . the top of the k-cup drawer is made of metal and does not have any padding ; however we have been using the happy toucan k-cup drawer for a long time now with a large keurig brewer on top and have not experienced any vibration problems or other problems at all when brewing our coffee . the metal is solid and very sturdy . 
hi nick , thank you for your question . the happy toucan drawer is designed for k-cups and capsules that range from 45 to 50 mm in height . we would n't recommend our drawer for the pads since what separates each row of the drawer is a bar and not a solid divider . if you also use capsules then they should work . thanks for your inquire and please let us know if you have any other questions . 
good day joe - good day - the dimensions of the bed in twin size are 41 '' d x 98 '' w x 64 '' h. in full size it becomes 57 '' d. thank you for allowing me to assist you - from the # 1 discovery world furniture seller on amazon - dreamscape furniture : ) feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you need further assistance . scott 
hello liz , the staircase beds can not be down stacked they will always be a bunk bed . thanks , drew 
i had the ipad 2 and it worked with that one as well as the 3 and i now have the ipad air that works fine . 
the stand is a good quality plastic ... we really like it . 
there is prox 1 2 '' of space for your tablet . if yours along with the case is less than that , then it should work . we take ours out of the case when we use it at home . 
i just tested it and it works quite well with the apple cover that i have . karen eurostoves 
yes . i have the ipad air smart cover front and back and it works great ! 
it has the symbol on the bottom that says you can . 
rings 
they are , but i would n't recommend it . washing them in the dishwasher wears down the coating faster . they are very easy to hand wash , stuck on food comes right off.. i love them ! 
i do n't know . seriously doubt that there be lead in them . check with mfg . 
8 '' frying pan , 10.5 '' frying pan , 5.5 '' sauce pan , 7 '' sauce pan , 8 '' sauce pan , & 10 '' chef 's pan w lids for all but the frying pans 
only certain foods in my case it was a portabella mushroom with balsamic vinegar left a small stain that has lighten over time not a real noticiable stain other than that this cookware is awesome . 4 1 2 stars 
it is very durable but i would still recommend it . 
yes they do . wear mitts . thr handles seem solid though . 
they are marked ptfe and pfoa free 
i have been looking at these same bowls and found the description on amazon lacking . i found info about these on a competitor 's site . the bowls are 18 10 stainless and are dishwasher-safe . the plastic lids are bpa-free and are safe on the top shelf of the dishwasher . hope that helps you out . 
to me they are sturdy , but not awkward to handle , if that 's what you 're asking . the metal does n't flex or give , but they are not heavy in weight . that is , they are lighter than the equivalent size glass mixing bowl . 
small one has a tight fit , the large one has a loose fit , and the medium one is in-between . i can mix a salad with the medium one safely . : ) 
i dont use my dishwasher so i do n't know . sorry 
i have n't put mine in freezer so i ca n't answer that ! 
lids are plastic . the entire inner surface of the bowl is stainless steel . i do n't know about the outer non-slip base , but it appears to be of a silicone-type material that makes the bowl stay in place on the counter . 
sorry no they are not made in the u.s.a. but i still think these are a good purchase . the bowls have interior measure markings and lids that seal tight . i am positive my daughter will get lots of good use out of this set . 
big bigger and biggest 
i looked everywhere on the tongs , but found nothing . where else , probably china . but , i will say it is my favorite ( i have 4 ) easy to hold , cool and a good length . 
do n't know where it was made , but it is very good quality . 
along the front diagonal edge of the bottom shelf . the right side measures approximately 14 inches . hope this helps ! 
mine is 8 7 16 inches ( just shy of 8 1 2 inches ) from the counter top to the bottom of the first shelf . 
we are very sorry to inform you that we do not sell it separately . 
mine was on the left side . hope it helps . 
they match the shelves , so yes i would say they stainless steel . it is a nice sturdy shelf too , well worth the money . 
yes it does 
there are 2 filters . a high deodorization anti-odor carbon filter and a hepa filter . replacement will vary depending on how often you use the filter . when you do change the filters it is recommend that you replace them . do not wash or reuse . 
filters el049 hepa , el050 carbon , and el043 hepa and carbon set all work on this unit . el049 hepa is $ 52.22 , el050 carbon is $ 50.33 , and el043 hepa and carbon set is $ 97.5 . thank you . 
not that i know of - i 'd call the customer service number and ask , or e-mail them . 
there are two styles of plates offered in this pattern . there are round place settings and there are square place settings . this place setting features the round plates . the square plates and place settings are more expensive . 
the dinner plates are 11.5 inches 
the mugs hold 2 cups to the brim , 12oz 3 4 filled , 8oz 1 2 filled . 
yes , it is dishwasher safe , and microwave safe too . 
it runs continuously . i have a device that measures electricity costs and if the fan runs 100 % ( without the compressor turning on ) i am showing only a cost of about $ 2- $ 3 per month . a lot of models seem to be this way ; the claim is that it keeps the air circulating and makes the unit more efficient to run . if it prolongs the life of the device ; it will be worth it in the end . 
yes , that is exactly what i have - imported from italy . no damage what-so-ever to the ceramic tile . 
i suppose you could . you would need to drill the holes through the bracket which is a type of hard plastic . you would need to drill those holes in the narrow space between the containers . the bracket is about 1 4 thick but hollow . the mounting they come with works well . 
i ordered and installed just one dispenser . if you have a three ganged dispenser send it back and order three separate ones . 
11.5 '' x 10.5 '' x 4 '' approximately . 
yes and it stays put.my shower is fiberglass and i love it ! its very easy to put up as well.make sure you give it 24 hours for the silicon glue to attach to your shower wall and you are good to go.you will not be disappointed.finally no more shampoo bottles falling down .

yes 
hello , it is w13.8 x d5.9 x h21.6 inches , thank you 
no , i have not used bananas . i usually use frozen frozen fruit with sugar-free fat-free vanilla yogurt . the yogurt makes the texture to be smooth and creamy . i evenly mix the frozen fruit with yogurt and splenda first before adding the ingredients down in the the shoot . 
i found that it is cremier with bananas , however you can still get a fairly creamy texture from using other fruits ( comes out like a sherbert or sorbet ) . i tried mine with just froze watermelon , cantelope , and pineapple and it was great ! healthy rainbow sherbert ! 
could n't be easier . you just cutup and freeze fruit the night before , or buy bagged , frozen friend . shove the pieces of frozen fruit into the shoot , press the button and out comes frozen desert ( like sorbet ) ... .i do n't add anything , no sugar , etc . perfect if you crave ice cream but are watching calories ... ..one of the best items i ever bought ! 
it does come with recipes . tried them and everything that it produced was disappointing . nothing that looked anything like what the one in the commercial made for sure . 
hi . it 's sturdy , easy to use & clean when done . i defrost for about 1 2 to an hour then put in slowly great treat . & healthy ! : ) 
i love the magic bullet ! ! ! ! ! 
it does . it 's smaller than i thought- it looks more like a pamphlet , but it has a lot of good recipes and contains a thawing guide for the fruit you use . i 've found the thawing time really makes a difference in the consistency . the book also gives you some of the nutrition information about each recipe , like the calorie count and the number of diabetic exchanges . 
it 's a snap close 
it is quite large , they call it jumbo size . the length is about 19 inches and the width is about 20 inches . it is very roomy inside . 
yes.. probably a 16 '' pizza at least.. its a big bag 
it can easily hold 3 large boxes of frozen food from sam 's club and 10-12 standard size frozen items from the grocery store . you can get a great deal in each bag . 
the large jumbo is 20x20x7in . the dimensions are on the bottom of the product picture .

we only have the shipping weight available ( 20lbs ) , but we are pretty sure the item itself weights less than 10lbs . 
basket itself is : 9 '' w x 5 '' d and 10 '' h ... a bit smaller than i would have liked . does n't hold a lot . 3 bags of marshmallows tops : ) wire is a bit flimsy also . it 's okay but thought i was getting a larger more sturdy basket . ca n't complain for the price , i guess . 
nope ... i used it to hold all those plastic grocery bags everyone packs items in ... used one to line and stuff in the rest of them ... not as large as i would 've like it to be . 
so hot that i ca n't drink the coffee without milk 
i never really stood and waited to see . i just plug it in and it does its thing ... i would say within 15 min its boiling ... 
hinged to come off on some models , not on mine 
16 '' h x 9 '' w over all , , watts 750 
made in china , however , if you 're really asking if it needs tevilah , it does not . it has a hechsher from r ' asher eckstein . 
most probably made in china , good with it , but pouring by pressing ( air ) only , no electronic pumping 
customer service ( 888 ) 552-0033 
yes , according to omega 's website . 
from my research , the nc900 `` chrome '' is more because of the chrome color . i guess they are looking at it like appliances . stainless is always more than the other colors . i hope this helps . 
it 's plastic , but it 's very durable . i imagine it 's due to the weight , as it 's already somewhat heavy . 
its fabric . 
3x3 going around 
yes , it is solid wood . 
no zippers on these pillows . 
the care label says `` spot clean only '' , so if there are major spills or messes , it would be a problem . however , i 'm very pleased with mine - they look nice and are comfortable . i do have animals and have to remove hair from them , but otherwise they are fine . 
all parts are bpa free . 
cleaning is super easy . especially if you put a plastic bag in the pulp catcher in the back . that way , you do n't have to bother washing that part out . everything else pretty much rinses out with hot water , except the blade itself . you 'll need a cleaning brush to clean it off . 
3600 rpm on the professional series ( wal-mart sells this one for $ 120 ) and 3000 rpm on the entry level series ( the one they advertise on the infomercial that is not stainless steel but is still $ 120 through them . i purchased mine from wal-mart so mine is stainless , 3600 rpm . ) 
i do n't know it has n't arrived yet 
the pitcher holds 8 cups . it 's comparable to other blender pitchers , but the blade and bottom are attached as all one piece , so there 's no leaking ! 
this is made for usa and is 110v 
my wife says , '' i suppose it could ? '' we have never tried and i do n't want to say yes , without knowing for sure . sorry 
hi . they do n't make it . the only one with glass pitcher is model number ksb565er which i have some left . thank you 
yes . anything kitchenaid is american made . see here : http : www.huffingtonpost.com 2012 07 07 american-made-products_n_1656135.html 
agree with mike h. the slats were just a hair too short . my husband ( weight : 240 ) laid on his side and a few of the slats instantly fell out . for me ( weight : 120 ) , it was fine but i was a bit hesitant at first . now that we 've had the bed for about a month , so far so good . overall , the structure of the bed is sturdy and feels sturdy . 
softwood has some metal brackets 
no there tends to be a small amount of space on each side . 
yes it does , and also you do n't need a box spring for it either . i 'm pretty happy with it . 
yes it does . 
it 's a medium gray . 
no 
no , it comes in boxes and was left when i was n't home . delivered via ups or fedex , do n't remember which one . 
5 inches 
yes , there is a zipper closure on the pillowcase . 
yes , it 's safe for machine washing : ) 
the apple peeler is made in china . as an american it was important for me to have the apple peeler made in the us . unfortunately , after several weeks of research i found out that there were no manufacturers left in the us who can make the peelers . 
no . the ge aros is equipped with a built in hooker retention device . 
this unit is terrible as far as the noise level is concerned ! in a bedroom ? really ... how could you sleep ? the low setting is the same as my samsung on high ! they failed miserably in this area ! ! ! ! ! ! i think the samsung is going back in as this is unbearable ! 
yes but it 's removable from the right side so unless your unit sticks out past the wall window sill , you 'll have to pull the whole unit out of the window to remove it . 
if your androids are consistently overheating then this would be a suitable device to lower their temperature , yes 
as of right now we only have the window model of aros available , but this is something we are exploring for the future . 
it can cool a room ~17 x 20 feet . 
as of right now the wink app is only available for apple and android devices , going forward we may be looking into windows . 
as of right now no . however , we are exploring different btu size units that will fit smaller windows . 
nope , i compared it to the other one i had at home and it was smaller with fewer coils . 
yes it is ! 
they are formed . just as picture shows they come on a plastic sealed bag . my daughter played with them and they did not break nice and strong . 
approximately 2.5 '' 
i believe so , the nalgene opening is fairly wide , correct ? i do n't think you 'd have any problems with the blender balls 
china 
the pillowtop on my mattress was dilapidated too . i put a fitted sheet over the mattress and pillowtop , placed the foam over sheet and then another fitted sheet over the foam and mattress . feels like a bit much at first , but now i love it . 
i do not know the answer to your question . andrew . i would ask the seller if i were you . they were most responsive when i had an issue with their product . 
it came vacuum sealed in a box about 2.5x2.5x1 ft and weighed about 25lbs . it was very manageable . 
the best i can tell you is im 5'3 and 160lb and my bf is 6'3 and 260lb plus or minus and i do not roll to the middle , hope that kinda of helps . also i can get out of bed for a few minutes and my indentation is already gone . 
i would reccomend getting a vacuum saver bag if thats the case . it doesnt fold up very small , but the vacuum saver bag should compress it down for easy storage . just remember to give it a few hours to reexpand before using 
less than 6 hours . i just opened it up in a room not being used . let it fully expand while kids were at school . it was ready before they got home . no bad odor and worked out great ! 
no , but i place it directly on top of the mattress and under the mattress pad . love it ! 
no . it rolls out and stays rolled out . i have never had an issue with that . 
i have several sets of these and although they are bpa free and 100 % food grade fda approved silicone there is no indication where they are made . i also checked their website and it does n't state there either . they do have a lifetime guarantee . 
my guess would be china , like everything else 
2 1 4 inches , measured with the lid on . 
2ounces 
gosh , most glassware is , but i would n't put the lid in there . ( i do n't recommend microwaving anything . ) 
10.5 inches long 3 inches tall 2 inches wide 
i have not personally tried to freeze anything yet , but they are glass so i do n't see why you could not use like a regular mason jar ( leave enough space for expansion ) . even if you do not use as intended , you wo n't be disappointed with these little jars . my friend uses the set i g ave her for salad dressings because they do not spill the liquid . 
they do not say , so i would assume - no . 
hi sandie . these are 16 ounces capacity . measurement is without lid , filled to top . hope this helps ! 
i do n't have a tervis straw to measure its diameter , but as long as the outside diameter is smaller than 6 16 '' ( i measured the opening at 6 16 '' ) you should be fine . 
yes ! i love them ! 
plastic 
acrylic plastic . very heavy though . study product . 
one co2 cartridge makes one liter fizzy water . cheers ! 
yes , they are , i am using generic ones , much cheaper 
go on utube . orange juice is too thick , must be watered down . wine did work . i would do only half of bottle because it makes a lot of fizz . you would be using a whole co2 cartridge for a small amount . the manufactures do not reconmmend it . 
no ! the top of the bottle has notches to lock . you can make it in the bottle that comes with it , then pour it into the soda stream bottle . 
each one is good for one bottle . you can get 100 for about $ 35 , which is a good deal . 
you could hide it behind the unit , but it all depends on your placement of the unit . mine covered my cable outlet , but my wall plug is off to the side . depending on your number of electronics , it could get full pretty quickly behind the unit if you place it over your wall outlet - depends on your cable management . 
im not sure as i have thrown away the box but i believe we have about 25-30 blue rays in each compartment 
if orders today it would ship on tuesday or wednesday and should arrive via ups the week of the 5th . although we can not guarantee when it will arrive once ups has possession of it . 
they are listed in the product description when you scroll down . just be careful of the top shelf as it is narrower then the lower so i had to change the shape of my lamp shades which are on it as the original ones did not fit . it is very well make and attractive . the person that installed it was very impressed . very clean and contemporary looking and with the space underneath i put my pouffs 
a cotton blend 
i do n't have the dimensions but it feels like an `` average '' size queen 
i do n't know . i bought a queen size . i think a king size would have fit my queen bed better . it 's really not wide enough . maybe you should get a full size , if you can see both sides of the bed . if it 's against a wall , it wo n't matter . 
i do n't think so . i 'll check when i get home today and let you know . it 's a very nice set , but i have only used the blue sides . 
hi , it only fits for a tilt head models which is the 5qts . thanks 
yes 
it did not fit my 6 qt kitchenaid , so it probably wo n't fit the 5 qt either . they are similar in size . 
i bought it to fit my 6 at and it does not fit . 
yes it is little tight but it will fit 
yes it does fit with the bowl attached . the only thing you have to store separate are the blades attachments . 
i bought this cover for my kitchenaid professional 600 and it did not fit . i 'm not sure about the professional 550 though . 
we have black and red as well . 
yes 
yep ! 
markers are sold separately . 
250 ibs 
19 inches . 
hi ellen , sorry we do n't have locking wheels . 
yes -- easy 
there are instructions that come with it that tells you how to use the manual release 
the battery door is located on the side that faces the lid being removed . it uses aa batteries . 
not really . i just wipe it w a papertowel . does the trick if it does . 
i think the answer to that is yes . however neither one of mine works at all . i 'm going to ask my son if he has some clue as to what makes them work but if he says no they are going into the trash . 
no 
i do not know never had a square can 
off white 
greetings , our supplier has stated that all you have to do is attach the legs . hope this was helpful ! thanks 
my daughter called me saying that it had no legs ... however it ended up being in a compartment under the couch ... it closes flush with velcro . i hope your is there too ... it is a pretty good chaise lounge chair . good luck . 
what a great thought ! yes , i do n't see why not ... 
yes . it is great for light ironing or pressing . ironing a dress shirt or a linen dress would be difficult because of limited space and the surface being entirely flat . i have creased jeans , touched up silk blouses and ironed capris with ease . mine is used on top of my washing machine , and having a hard surface helps . for touch-ups it should work fairly well on a bed . hope this helps . 
yes ... .it 's a great substitute 
absolutely ! in fact , i have used it in my granite countertop and my wood table . the mat is completely cool underneath after using . 
i would n't , since it 's not thick enough to protect the table from heat . 
can be used on any flat surface . 
there are magnets on the 4 corners only . 
i 'm not sure ... . only used it for regular lunch items ... .but looked sturdy . 
it is microwave safe , so i just assumed it was dishwasher safe too . have been putting it in the top rack with no problem ; still a waterproof seal . 
the separate 'sandwich box ' , which can be used to hold anything , has a lid that closes nicely , and stays on tightly , but does not actually lock . a rubber band may work . i posted a video at www.kamipeck.com . hope it helps 
yes it does . 
3pc set = item dimensions : 10 '' l x 6 '' w x 2 1 4 '' h 4pc set = item dimensions : 11 '' l x 6 3 4 '' w x 2 1 4 '' h all dimensions are extremely close but may not be exact . 
we let ours sit for 4 hours ... .not even ... and it was fine . 
yes and yes . one of the beds we use a similar mattress on is from ikea and has a slat base . even works there . 
it comes rolled . box is about 18 '' square . wo n't fit in a car trunk though . 
no . 
i have n't noticed that yet , but i 've only used it in the winter . it does n't seem to get too hot now . 
only had this one for about 18 months . the original foam mattress we purchase is 5+ years old and shows no sign of wear .

great question.. give it a try with the mixture of water for the epsom salt to freeze in a mold . post your result please ! 
too many styles of rocks glasses to be certain . the 2-1 2 '' diameter in the description is correct , so just measure the glass . 
the sellers send it to you after your purchase . it 's in pdf format . great recipes ! 
china 
hi luckas in order to avoid a crack in the middle , you need to ensure that both molds are completely dry before snapping together . the reason for this is that water expands when frozen which would cause a crack in the middle . hope this helps ! 
the packaging does not say bpa free , but it does say that it is 100 % fda grade silicone . 
hello wendy - the board is about .5 '' thick and does not have any feet . hope that helps . mike . 
hello jeanne - we would not recommend using in the dishwasher . best wishes - mike . 
the color is as pictured.. i love mine ! 
this piece of furniture took me many hours to assemble ( about 7-8 hours over two days ) and you will need at least one other person to help you , as some pieces are very heavy and it 's difficult to fit the pieces together without another set of hands . beautiful end result though and pretty sturdy for pressed wood ! 
i do n't know what exact size of box was but it was very large and very heavy . my husband had a hard time getting it up the stairs . 
yes they are two separate drawers . so all together the dresser has 4 drawers and 2 cabinets 
the middle drawer areas are fairly wide ; however , there is not a brace in the middle of the two drawers so you could only remove the bottom drawer . 
the dresser is very sturdy and can hold a television . keep in mind you have to build it yourself so how sturdy it comes out also depends on you . 
the wide mouth lids will fit any wide mouth jar : pint , quart , or half gallon . 
the jars are glass , the lids are plastic . they work great and i use my jars all the time ... especially now that i have the lids with the straws in them and can access freshly made juices , etc away from home 
it does not leak out of the lid or the rubber grommet . its a water tight fit . the straw is hard to get in the grommet tho . you have to get it wet first and twist it while you push it in the lid . liquid will come out of the straw tho , but that part is expected . we love the lids . 
they can be used with pint or quart jars 
the hole size is normal straw size . i do n't see why it would not work . you would get a good seal and the cap is very durable . 
it would depend on how the soap pump is anchored in . we have never tried this yet . 
you can always call the seller and ask that . 
yes and no . when the tank runs out of water , a switch that floats sinks and turns off the ultrasonic transducer ( the dime-sized disk inside ) . the front control and blower remain on . the floater is much better than sensors that sit in the water and need cleaning . 
our model only says hm2610 . there is no `` -u '' . this is an ultrasonic humidifier . our experience has much different from the `` minnesota nice '' reply below . we had an older holmes humidifier and this one is much better . very quiet and disperses a lot of moisture into the air . you just reminded me i told my brother i 'd send this information to him because he needs moisture in his home in addition to the humidifier . good luck with your purchase 
sorry , but i returned this item because i did n't want to have to continue to buy the tablets . 
no . takes regular water . 
for parts and availability , please call us at ( 800 ) 546-5637 ; monday through saturday from 8 am to 8 pm , est . 
made in china . 
this unit has a 1-year manufacturer warranty . 
as long as you keep it clean & maintain it per directions . 
mounted like artwork . sticks out from wall . 
dimensions are listed under product details . 
110 x 96 `` it is cut to have shams . if you email me at lisag30 @ yahoo.com i have more pictures if you would like to see the fabric and bedspread . if you would like to see the color better . 
big enough to amply cover a king size bed . look up dimension for king size beds ! 
25 oz . 
yes , that way when you pull it out by the handy handle you wo n't burn your hands . this is a great product ! i really do love it , the bowl is the perfect size . 
yes , it comes in a retail-type box . 
not for sure , but i doubt it very much . 
the muffin pan is a standard size , 12.8 x 9.7 x 1.2 inches . each cup holds 2.5 oz and measures 2 3 4 inches across . 
abraham , each cup holds about 2.5 oz or 75 ml and is the same size as most standard metal muffin pans . 
no . i just put the mixture in and placed it in the oven . worked perfectly ! 
thanks for your question . the bottom diameter of each cup is about 2 inches or 5 cm . 
the recommended maximum oven temperature is 480f ( 250c ) . 
have n't tried it , but the manufacturer claims it 's microwave safe . i believe most food-grade silicone products are microwave safe . 
yes . ea108t is the recommended sleeve for that model . 
yes , you do need a sleeve or a hole cut through the wall . it is not for window installation . 
yes just hit the fan button and fan will come on without compressor 
yes it is , although the frigidaire is 20 1 2 '' deep so it will stick out an additional 3 4 '' . 
please refer to page 12 of the owner 's guide . http : manuals.frigidaire.com prodinfo_pdf edison 2020213a1627en.pdf 
yes , this heater is ul approved . also , works very well . my favorite feature aside from the timer , is the auto shut off . if this heater is not sitting in it 's upright position it turns off immediately . oh ya , the fan mode actually works as well . worth every dime . 
yes 
yes it will . 
6 feet 
yes , i think it is quiet 
no . item uses a standard 110 120v outlet . 
i believe not metal though the humidity inherent in most bathrooms does not work well with this product . a shame , too , because it 's capacity is well suited for such a space 
unfortunately ( or fortunately ) , it is not very loud at all since the fan does not generate much output . 
no . 
we keep the litter box in the basement so i ca n't answer that directly . but we 've found it even removes the scent of a holiday candle or baking from the surrounding rooms . 
do n't know about tobacco odor as there is no smoking in our house , but if someone passes gas the fan cranks up to high in a matter of seconds : ) 
absolutely . i would not use an ionizer and i turned mine off . very easy to do ! just press one button . on the front of the unit , there are various buttons with lights underneath . the very bottom button looks like a star ( ? ) if this is lit blue , the ionizer is on . to turn it off , press and hold the button until the light goes off ( this take a few seconds ) . good to go , without ions . 
no and was not designed too . 
not right next to you , as far as possible away in the same room . at first i was sleeping under it , and it dried out my hair , my throat and i had difficulty swallowing . it works just not meant to be close to you . 
the vacuum is self adjusting . it easily handles going from a smooth surface to carpet . in my house there is up to 1 2 inch difference . the only thing you need to do is push the brush button once on carpet . 
it 's not self-propelled , so it can be a workout . you might want to look elsewhere . 
you sure can lloyd ! as the other responders mentioned this works great for cleaning cars and was one of the main reasons we designed this vacuum ! 
this machine comes with a 5 year limited warranty .

i do n't know the warranty period but had a problem with minor shipping damage , which should have been able to be repaired under warranty . the company said it would be covered and referred me to a local supplier who handles their warranty work , but the local vendor refused because we did not buy it from them . we had to return the unit to amazon and bought another unit locally . 
yes , i am able to draw in outside air but i can not exhaust it , 
yes , prongs are standard and fit into a standard 3 prong wall socket but the body surrounding the plug is a 2 x 3 inch 90 degree plug . you would use the lower wall socket to plug the ac into and then a standard ( for instance lamp cord plug ) into the upper wall socket . the reason the ac unit plug is large is because it contains a safety shut-off mechanism in the body to protect unit from electrical overloads that could create shorts fires . check the specs because the electrical socket must be 15 amps . this is pretty standard . it is a nice unit . we really enjoy ours.. 
yes , no indicator for it on the remote control screen though . 
no it does not 
not really . look for models that are specifically designed for such windows . frigidaire make a few . frak series 
the ability to heat just milk , for one . ability to dispense hot water . larger milk , water and spent pod reservoirs . led display . you are prompted to clean the milk receptacle . a 'ristretto ' setting ( very small amount of espresso ) . i have both and use both every morning when preparing lattes for my husband any myself . no need to have two , but i 'm keeping the plus as a back-up . the pro drew me in with the milk and water settings . i like just steamed milk occasionally ( much better steamed than from the aeroccino ) , and my husband enjoys tea , so it is nice to have the hot water setting . and to be honest , i just like a little coffee with my milk , so i am often adding more milk than the latte setting provides ( yes , i do realize i can customize that output on both machines , but not everybody feels the same as i do about milk qty ) . very sturdy machine . more sleek than the plus . and when i say milk , i mean coconut flavored almond milk . the primary reason i purchased a nespresso machine in april 2013 was to have lattes with non-dairy and non-soy options . at the time , last april , starbucks and peets did not offer almond milk . peets now does , but they do n't have coconut flavored - it makes all the difference . 
a caffe lungo , also known as a long coffee or caffe americano , is an espresso with double water and comes pretty close to what we yanks call coffee . caffee lungo is one of the choices on this machine . 
no . it 's much better . i had a sbux one today because i got a gift card and i waited 10 minutes for an inferior drink . the sbux espresso is not even in the same league . pa

no idea 
i use unsweetened almond milk almost exclusively and it works great ! 
it 's pretty tall to be a nightstand . it 's not the most stable item either . i would advise against using it as such . 
about 3 ' tall 
it holds light desk items for my daughter at school . it does n't appear to be able to hold very much in my opinion just very cute ! 
96 wrappers 
they have a pearl finish and are almost like plastic . they made an elegant display for an 80th birthday party 
it 's 28 1 8 '' tall . 
i think it could work . there is n't a real wide lip though . 
we only use it to play cards . however , it seems very sturdy . 
i do n't have it set up , but i measured the legs and added an inch for the thickness of the table top itself , and i got 28 '' . i also measured another card table that i do have set up and which i think is the same size , and i got 28 '' . so 28 '' + - and inch . i used it outdoors and it got rained on . the rain beaded up on the finish , but i 'm not sure the top did n't absorb from the humidity in the air , and it 's now a bit saggy in the middle . still quite usable , but thought you might want to know . 
no , the entire table is black . 
the resin top is very bumpy , not smooth . it really depends on how you want to use table . resin top not good for writing or dining , but it is very durable . 
i would not trust it for weight . i have a table you can get at staples , or bjs or costco that 's longer and much sturdier . this table looks great and has nice surface but it wiggles on a bare floor which is disappointing . fine on rugs . good for doing puzzles and games , and does look nice but i would not put a lot of weight on it . 
yes ... it 's quite heavy ... but i would add there is a very slight texture to the top 
i would think so . they are pure stainless . 
actually , no , as they are different diameters . 
overall dimensions : h 7 1 2 `` . w 7 1 2 `` , l 11 '' . shelf height . 2 1 2 `` for bottom 2 shelfs , top has no top . 
the feet ( base ) are pretty small . i have mine on a wire shelf , but there 's an acetate liner that 's acting as a base . there 's a 7 inch span between the center of the feet on the short side , if that helps . my shelves have the right spacing for the shelf to sit securely even if i did n't have the acetate . if the feet do n't line up with your shelf , you could use something underneath it as a base . 
7 1 2 to 7 3 4 inches between shelves . 
yes-definitely . good size ones too . 
38.5cm 
i have mine full of jars of spices and the shelf bottoms bow ever so slightly , barely noticable . i love it . 
no , it is rather flimsy . 
no it has plates that you can clean 
if the ozone filters are new then low . turn it up as they age ( about 6 months ) 
warranty on this product ? 
standard . they would could go in a regular muffin pan but instructions say you can put on a cookie sheet and cook that way . 
made in china 
well i have a mini muffin pan and these would n't fit in that . using a box mix specifically to make 12 cupcakes it came out perfectly so they are regular sized just slightly smaller the the pans would be which is how any of the paper cups would have also been . i have pictures on my blog of them in a full sized muffin pan reviewstuffz.blogspot.com 
hand wash 
yes . you attach the `` leash '' just in case . you will find it difficult to lean or the window and get it going though . best if you can be outside . 
110 and 220 
no , it will only work on square and rectangle shaped windows that have a frame . it wo n't work on rounded glass . 
winbot w710 is designed for framed windows and mirrors , while winbot w730 works on framed and or frameless windows and mirrors . 
i was n't sure about that either - the windows i was purchasing the item for had frames so went with that . however , the question that no one answered for me was whether it had to have electrical cord . i had to return it when i found the cord was required - since the windows i had hoped to use it on are quite large and the thought of a heavy cord dragging around over everything beneath just would not have worked . great idea - just waiting for battery-powered version . 
not sure 
12.5 amps or less . depends on the setting . the quality on this unit is atypical of friedrich units . this one 's made in china . poor quality compared to the usa made units . i would not buy it again . too expensive to send back or have serviced . 
the unit has a cool , dry and fan modes . it functions as an ac . 
overall width : 26 '' overall depth with front : 26 7 8 '' overall height : 16 7 8 '' 
yes , it does . very convenient . 
yes , but sold couch after buying . cheap couch . 
what you see you get ! great sofa ! 
it weighs around 85 lbs . 
generally , the thicker the mattress , the more plush soft the mattress will be . the 8 '' is designed for back sleepers . the 10-12 '' is designed for back side sleepers . the 13 '' is designed for all around sleeping , including on the stomach . memory foam mattresses will contour to your body during your rest , as it reacts to temperature . it will support your full body by contouring to your body shape . our spring mattresses , still give support , as your body will contour to the individually wrapped coils . 
i do n't see why not . there were no warnings from the co. i would use my heated mattress pad with no reservations . have a good day . 
not sure what the spring count is , but my husband both weight over two hundred pounds . we love our mattress , made living in the travel trailer while my husband worked out of town bearable ! 
there is about2 inchs of memory on the top hope this helps 
they certainly are not flat . i would say about they are about 6 inches thick . and you could bunch it up and make it higher , i would think . i will say i bought one for all my children and their spouses because my husband and i loved our 's so much . great night sleep without fighting the darn pillow . hope this helps you . 
i have not tried . let me check . no i can not . mine has the cover to it and then the actual pillow . i hope this helps . 
just one , but it is worth every penny ! ! ! best pillow i have ever owned ! ! 
i do n't know - there were n't any in min e 
the spigot is acrylic . 
1.38 gallons , or 5.22 liters 
india . 
no they are not serrated , but they do have a cutting edge . be aware however , that the knives are less than 18 10. overall we like the set . handles are large and large forks do not fit in the individual tableware holders in the dishwasher . 
the stamp on the knives says `` stainless '' `` handles 18 10 '' so i do n't know about the blades , but never have had any problems or issues with them and have owned them for 10+ years . i do n't use harsh cleaners ( e.g. , powders ) or non-gentle scrubbing pads . hope this helps . 
no royce , it is made in vietnam . 
yes 
no idea . i hand wash mine 
no , it is one solid cup . the lid and straw are the only removable parts . the straw is a bit delicate , as i found out when i put it in the sink and then placed a pot on top accidentally . 
nearly 10.5 '' and are made to fit the opening in the lid . i use 9 '' disposable straws so i do n't have to wash the straws that come with this cup , and these straws work just fine . hope this helps . 
i have not tried to freeze them . and i do n't think it would work very well . if the expanding liquid did n't break them , the extreme cold would probably make them more prone to crack 
the lid screws on with a rubber seal inside the cap . 
7 3 4 inches . 
yes 
yes 
large is 9x11 medium is 8.5x11 small is 8x6 
do n't put in the dishwasher - the more delicate you handle it the longer it 'll last . wash with soap and water , dry immediately and it will stay in great condition ! 
large is 9x11 medium is 8.5x11 small is 8x6 
large is 9x11 medium is 8.5x11 small is 8x6 
the manual does n't say anything about the machine `` turning off , '' it merely says `` red light indicates that water bottle needs to be refilled . '' but , crane humidifier representatives say that their animal-shaped humidifiers turn `` off '' when they run out of water , even though the red light is still on . so , i think it 's reasonable to expect that other manufacturers have likewise designed their humidifiers so the mechanism stops running when the water supply runs out . my miso humidifier often stays empty-but-on for a while before i get around to turning it off and it 's still operating fine . once the red light switches on it 's as quiet as as when it 's all the way off . just make sure you turn it off and empty it all the way out if you 're not actively using it for a while . 
no i checked and it is strictly an electrical plug in . 
i do n't use a filter with mine ... . i do n't think it needs one . one peeve is that it does n't fit all water bottles . mostly your cheap generic nestle type bottles . dasani and smart do n't fit 
in the usa , 120 volt ac is converted by the transformer on the wire that plugs into the outlet to 24 volt dc . 
yes- and it comes with a little cleaning brush that lets you reach all the little crevices . 
dry eyes is one reason i purchased it for my office at work . my eyes have been watering for several hours in the morning , which can be caused by dry air . i have only used this unit for one week so do n't know the results yet , but it certainly ca n't hurt since it will add moisture to the air . 
yes , i believe it would . if it can handle large cookie sheets and muffin tins it should also hold platters ... ..of course , depending on their size . i found it important that the organizer not be a lot narrower than the width of the cabinet ... ..the sides of the cabinet help to hold everything in place . 
yes it is . the slots are wide enough . 
wide 9 '' , deep 9 '' , height 5 '' , between rows 3 '' . 
actually not bad , if you have any problem use the little felt pads on the feet 
unless fastened to a side wall , if stood so opening for storage is horizontal , it would tip over . 
hello , if you mean hot tea and coffee , yes they will work . thank you for your interest . 
yes ! i put bot the lids and the straws in my dishwasher . the straws are large , so they go well in the silverware bucket and do n't fall through . 
hi sybil . these were made in china . 
yes . i use the lid and straw for my juice drinks and ice water . i love the tops . it turns the jar into a perfect reuse able water bottle . i have never liked plastic or aluminum water bottles , so this works great for me . 
yes , but disposable straws are significantly smaller than the supplied straws ( and more wasteful ! ) . 
they are pba free plastic-diswasher safe too . love them . 
they can but i would n't recommend it 
as listed in the product description , each cup is approximately 2-5 8 '' diameter at the top , 1-3 4 '' diameter at the bottom , and 1-1 4 '' tall ; each cup holds about 2-1 4 fluid ounces to the rim . 
made in china , but looks come from a company in utah . i could n't recommend these highly enough - we just love them because they sturdy . 
this is briefly mentioned in the description . each cup holds about 2-1 4 ounces to the rim . 
hello ! i do n't see why not , but the question is why ? the point of these is so that it is easy to pop the muffins out instead of peeling the paper . 
yep ! they are the same size as a paper cupcake liner . i love mine ! 
no , the package states made in china 
this is the exact same machine , except this bundle includes the cookie paddles . 
i believe it 's made in the us , but i 'm not really sure . do a google search on the company and perhaps you can locate it . 
i 've added as much as 16 cups of flour in the bosch and it handled it extremely well . 
yes 
i can not speak for the trundle bed , but i have often been on the bed with my daughter ( 3 1 2 ) , and our combined weight does n't seem to be an issue . i weigh about 200 pounds ; she weighs closer to 30. it certainly seems sturdy enough to be a bed for an adult . 
no , it just slides out . 
no and i would not buy this bed - i had a terrible experience with this company when the bed rail broke in two . 
we used a regular twin on both beds and they work great . 
yes , just measured it and would fit fine . i have a 7 '' and there is still more room . 
yes it can - but the first night we had the bed - , the rail broke in half - not a strong bed - home and living has been terrible with us and still have not received the part 
hb 36 '' , fb 23 '' 12 12 slats 
the 450 is the latest unit and it is easier to clean and also vacuums when cleaning . by what i have read about the 390 they have issues with leaving water and cleaning them out . the 450 so far has been brilliant . it cleans the floor so well it shines . so far i am very impressed with 450. hope it helps . 
the ones from my 800 series did not work , but they are lighthouses that you can set as virtual walls . 
hello , if you request it , we can supply the worldwide 100-240v power supply . 
if you run it regularly , the scoobs does a fair job of `` sweeping . '' but , cleaning it becomes messier as the amount of dirt it picks up increases . i run my roomba vacuum before running the scooba . 
it does , but you need to supply your own two pin kettle lead . 
hello- yes 1 year parts & labor warranty . 
the scooba will break if you use anything but water , water vinegar solution , or the stuff that they make you buy just for scooba . i have been through 3 scoobas and it turns out that they have a sensor inside ( customer service told me ) that will be destroyed degraded if the solution is n't one of the above . in fact , i thought that i could at least suck up whatever i put down , including diluted mr. clean . nope . it broke on that ... technically i was not breaking the `` rules '' not to use someone elses ' cleaner , but it broke it . the vinegar water solution does an excellent job , stick with that and you 'll do fine . 
it is not possible to have a dock with something that uses liquids and would still be wet when returning to a dock without the possibility of shorting out the electrical and setting the house on fire . 
these knives contain carbon so prolonged periods of moisture such as a dishwasher or soaking in a sink can lead to rust issues on the blade and under the handle plus the harsh detergents can stain the metal and the high heat can cause the handles to crack . dishwasher safe knives have a coating to prevent rust spotting and are available on amazon also and are less expensive too so that may be another option . 
you need to talk to an amazon customer service person . prime members pay about $ 99.99 a year and en they get benefits from amazon like deals on shipping , movies and other savings . 
china if i knew this before i would not have bought this item 
what 's in the box ? 8 '' slicer , 8 '' chef 's knife , 7 '' santoku knife , 5 '' utility knife , 5.5 '' boning knife , ( 6 ) 4.5 '' steak knives , 3.5 '' paring knife , kitchen shears , and black storage block . 
gave it as a gift . she loves it 
no . steak knives are serrated . and the bread knife . and a few other are serrated and a few are not serrated . 
all except the largest knife is serrated . the scissors are regular scissors . i love my set . 
i have owned this set for a few months now . i have not tried to sharpen them because they are still as sharp as the first day i got them . they do not show sign of dullness . hope this helps . 
no , it is made in china 
yes , it comes with a tray . 
hi loving life , it is 1000w . if you have any other questions do n't hesitate to ask . thanks gowise usa 
no there is no delay start option . 
it is a piece of junk ! ! i sent 2 back 
it comes in 4 quarts 6 quarts and 8 quarts 
it does not have a light to indicate when it needs to be cleaned , but it 's really easy to open and get the filter out . it does help with pet dander ... we have a bulldog and she sheds like crazy ... this machine picks up the smallest of junk in the air . we live in texas and it 's naturally dusty & lt ; i have to dust at least 3 times a week because of my husband 's allergies - but with this on - i 'm down to once a week yay ! & gt ; . my husband had severe allergies and was sneezing at least 25 times a day ... .i have n't heard him in over a week & lt ; the last time i cleaned the filter & gt ; . i know when it 's time to clean the filter because his eyes water and he sneezes a lot . this has 3 speeds . quick clean , reguar , and whisper clean . i use quick clean after i change the filter and let it run for 30-45 minutes , then i change it to regular for 2-3 days , and then i run it on whisper clean the rest of the time . if it gets really dusty , like when we do yard work & lt ; the dust always gets in the house & gt ; , or we cook fish or something that really stinks - i change it to quick clean . you 'll be able to figure out a routine that works best for you . i hope his helps ! 
no , it only has a paper filter that you vacuum and reuse . for its size , it does a nice job . no replacement filter needed . i use it in my 10 x 11 home office which always has visitation from our cat and dog . ( i am allergic to the cat and it keeps the air filtered ) . i truly notice the difference . 
we have had one for years and love it , but it works slowly to clean the air in a small room over time and does a great job at controlling normal dust and dander - - - if you mean while you are scooping or pouring litter , this unit is less than ideal for clouds of dust . 
while i 'm not a smoker , my son is . it will take a minute or two to clear the air , but the tobacco smell will shortly go away . as noted in my review i 'm very pleased with the hb and suggest adding the 3m filtrete to the installed filter if you have allergy problems . for the money , the hb is a very good buy ! i hope this helps you . 
it helped with musty smells and even helped with paint and harsh chemical smells 
no this model uses hepa filter . 
i have no idea about the cadr and merv rating . i sent this over to my son in afghanistan as the dust was so bad over there . he said it worked great and was easy to clean as well . so i 'm just giving you second hand info but hope it helps . it made life more bearable for him . 
hello , the dimensions of our hand towels are 16 inches by 30 inches . if there is anything else we may assist you with , please feel free to contact us . 
hello carol , like with any other product , it can be bleached . we recommend using a small amount and not putting it directly onto the product . please let us know if we may assist you further . 
have to disagree with that answer . just to clarify ... to make a 12 oz mug of coffee , i press the `` + '' button once , and then the `` start '' button . on the third morning after i 'd gotten the t55 , mine ran out of water in the middle of brewing a mug . it stopped the brewing process . not knowing exactly what to do , i refilled the tank , crossed my fingers , and pressed the start button ... and it finished brewing the mug , releasing the correct amount of water , without overflowing . as explained in my review of the t55 , the tank 's water level is clearly visible from the front of the machine , through a `` window '' , when there is no cup on the holder . the top of the window is just above the `` max fill '' line , and the bottom of the window is about half-an-inch above `` empty '' . to brew a 12 oz mug , the water level needs to be about 1.5 '' above the bottom edge of the window . i do n't use the water-filter or its holding-tank ; simply filling the main tank with filtered water , instead . this allows me to brew four 12 oz mugs before needing to refill the tank . 
they make a reusable t-disc that you can add whatever coffee you prefer into ; http : www.my-cap.com my-cap-products-for-tassimo-brewers reusable-t-disc-for-tassimo-brewers-detail.html 
absolutely . tea , hot chocolate , espeesso , latte , capps , regular and decaf coffee . 
i believe you can put the descaling disc in the machine and when you run it it dispenses hot water . you may want to check their website to verify that . holding down the brew button makes it descale but pushing it once normally should just fill the cup with hot water . 
110 
yes , a filter came with it . i have filtered water from my refrigerator door so i never replaced the filter in the machine . it works great . 
yes 
twin ... not good quality 
i believe it 's actually a queen size as my standard pillowcases are too small for it but my king pillowcases fit it nicely . 
it had a strange chemical like odor the first night i used it . i think it was from the plastic bag that it came in . i washed the pillow and the odor mostly went away . it is gone now a week or so later . 
i 'm not sure , but the product descriptions said a lifetime ... .. however amazon has a 30 day return . my hubby & i love pillows and will use replace them if necessary in several years . they really help and exceed the product descriptions . they are with the money . 
i measure 18.5 inches 
the coloration particularly considering the texture is more ivory white . 
only if it came from a vinyl cow ... ... . 
it does off some lumbar support and it is a comfortable chair to sit in , but the lumbar support is not adjustable . 
i use the clorox wipes to wipe down the chair 
no 
the chair will accommodate larger person . the base cushion is about 22 '' deep and 24 '' wide . however the arms can adjust outward to about 36 '' wide . the side arm also adjust up and down . i would say a person 300+ lbs and a heath up to 6 ' 5 '' would find this chair comfortable ... 
seat size : 22.75 '' w x 20.5 '' d back size : 21.5 '' w x 27.5 '' h seat height : 20 - 24.25 '' h 
james , i bought this chair about ( 2 ) weeks ago and really like it . i just measured it for you and it appears to be 22.5 inches from floor to the top of the seat area . i 'm 6'6 '' , 280 and it fits me very well . i use the chair at a few inches lower than full up so i have room under my desk . good luck . 
pull the up down adjustment handle out , towards the wall , parallel to the floor . 
yes on the right hand side of the chair there is a little pull handle that unlocks the tilt so it can tilt . 
they measure about 17 3 4 x 7 x 17 3 4. i constantly use mine . my only problem is getting my kids to return them when they 've borrowed them . i need to order more . 
17 3 4 '' tall , 17 3 4 '' wide , and 7 '' in depth just as stated in product description . i measured them after i received my first order and the measurements given are accurate . 
measurements given on product page are accurate once opened as in picture . they hold a lot and seem very sturdy . i have 4 of this size and family members own 6 or 7 of the larger bags that keep in cargo area to tote groceries in the house or whatever . recently used several of both sizes when i cleaned out linen and clothes closet for donations which saved on number of trips to car to load up . very versatile bags for anything you need to tote around . 
they are about 4.25 inches high by about 2.75 inches across the middle of the top and 2 inches across the middle of the bottom . they hold 10 oz to the top of the cup . 
i do n't think so . i bought these and they are a thicker plastic . i always have to wash them on the top rack of the dishwasher . i washed one on the bottom and it melted the bottom . for this reason , i do n't think they have melamine because i do n't think it would have melted after one wash if it had . they are very sturdy cups . i 've washed them a ton in the dishwasher and there is no fading . i love them and highly recommend them ! 
there is no code 
no they will not . they are great cups 
as long as they are on the top rack , we have never had a problem with the cups flipping . 
yes , bpa free ! ! we 've been using them a month and they still look new.. really great cups ! 
hello leigh , i am sorry we only offer this as a multi color set right now . us acrylic , llc 
they are hard plastic . 
i checked mine monthly and used judgement on calcium build-up . a lot depends on hardness of your water . i never used more than two per season but , only ran it for 6 months per year since i live in the northeast ( another factor to consider ) . 
warranty is for 5 years for parts , but not labor . no mention of licensed hvac installer in my owner 's manual . 
the fan draws air from within the duct through the moist evaporator panel and back into the duct . there is no room air pulled in through this action . 
yes , the ice pack is included in the purchase . i have n't used the ice pack so i ca n't speak to how cold it keeps the food , but it seems like it 's in a good place to keep both the dip and veggies chilled . overall i love it . perfect size for a healthy snack and dip . 
i ordered three of these ( love them btw ) and they were all different . think i got the turquoise , yellow and and a purple one . you ca n't request colors . so do n't count on getting a particular color that you want . love the ice packs in them tho . 
only one and the dip container is very small . if i had seem this in person i may not have bought it . 
yes , and stays on as long as the door is open 
hxdxw = 12 3 4 '' x 16 '' x 21 3 4 '' 
from my experience you have to clear the timer first , but there may be a way ! 
no . the inside is painted white . 
no it 's white metal , i 've had this for several months and i am very happy with it , it works great gets food hot very quickly . hope i helped you in some way .

from end to end , it 's 6 inches . 
it can certainly be placed on the top during infusion , but does not fit like a lid . this is an excellent item ! 
we use about 4 teaspoons in a 48 oz tea pot . 
it is 2.5 '' tall . 
good question . it snaps into place when you fold or unfold it , so you can lift it out of the mug with one handle . each side of the handle folds separately , and it stores nicely in the plastic container if you want to make a quick cup in the morning and bring the wet leaves to work with you for a second steeping . although it is not as big as my other infuser , it works perfectly with my 20 oz mug , and even fits the smaller opening on my 24 oz tea pot . i love it . 
yes they are both designed with extra fine holes so you can use with fine loose tea . 
not at all . 
they stay on a magnetic strip fine with the sheaths removed , but not with the sheaths on . the sheaths are made of a firm plastic , which is not magnetic . 
my daughter says usa 
you can try contacting the shun knife company online and see if they can direct you . they are the ones who make the kai pure komachi knives . i bought a magnetic knife strip from amazon and my knives sit on the strip attached to the wall so they are within easy reach . it 's an alternative to trying to track down another sheath . 
in order to find out , i googled the knife set and discovered them on the shun website . that makes them japanese , who are known for superior knives and blades , in general . just the name kai komachi is a tip off that it is japanese but it 's always good to make sure . hope this helps . 
yes . it is a good habit to sharpen after each wash. but , i dont always do that and they are still super sharp . 
nature of the business , i would think . `` to the buyer beware '' as the saying goes . shop around , find the best deal that suits your needs . do you want to use up your car and gas mileage , ( maybe hop the bus , or even train ) , or is it going to be less costly to buy online ? will it possibly save you valuable time or will it end up evening out ? if you find you need to return it , what options do you have ( i.e. , free return label , etc . ) , either way and how will that possibly affect overall cost ? takes a bit of figuring out what works best for you . btw : as of 12 25 2013 , i ca n't even find these at costco anymore . darn ... 
hi bb , you can cut them if you want to , but the mats were not meant to be cut . they are very flexible , so should be able to sit well in most standard pan sizes . how large is your pan ? 
they are very thin , about 1mm in thickness . 
hi our mats are made in china . 
so i looked over the box and instructions but it does not have any information on what it is made of . i would say it is not bpa free because they would have it clearly written on the box . 
about a 1 2 gallon . lasts all 10-12 hrs at moderate settjng 
i used an essential eucalyptus oil in it . not more than half a dropper worth , but it was enough to basically corrode the plastic on the inside of the humidifier . this was my fault ! not at all blaming this otherwise stupendous product , as i just bought a replacement , but i essentially ( pun ? ) wrecked my previous one . learn from my mistake . 
cool . i was surprised ! 
there is an off on indictor light on the front , very small . no light that illuminates the plastic area . 
i do not find it noisy at all . i am very sensitive to noise and have to keep my air filters at the lowest setting ( and some brands even the lowest is too noisy for me ) . this humidifier does n't bother me even at higher settings and i have no problem sleeping soundly while it is on . 
yes 
this is a very nice silicone tray , however , i was a little surprised at the size of the cavities . they are very small . i make wax melts with this tray . hope this helps . 
bed skirt , fitted sheet , top sheet , comforter , two blue ruffled pillow cases , two white pillow cases , two medium throw pillows , 2 small throw pillows ! 
it is cream 
no curtains come with the 12 piece set 
it is the same color as the face of the comforter 
i believe that it is 300. they were way softer than i expected them to be though . super comfy . 
probably on top if room permits in your dish washer , but not on bottom since it is plastic or plastic-like material . however , we have always taken a minute to hand wash and wipe ours to store as soon as we finish using it . 
i have had no issues with it staining . 
i make mine in the evening for the next day 
tried loose tea leaves once . used cold water and let it sit overnight . the tea was very weak and there was a lot of sediment in the pitcher . i will not try again . 
hi joy ! this pitcher is ten inches tall and ls the greatest ! there are endless possibilitiesfor flavoring and the plastic is high quality durable . 
this attractive pitcher fits perfectly in my refrigerator door . one of my best purchases ! 
no.. i just wash and cut to fit . love this . 
yes , i brew tea in boiling hot water and turn it into iced tea 
since when did 120vac at 0.9a equal 275 watts ? try 108 watts . 
so far i 've only done meringue with 5 egg whites , to make buttercream , and also i 've beaten cakes up to 2 pounds of ingredients , so i guess it it powerful enough to beat 8 egg whites . 
no 
this mixer came with a 'kitchenaid ' bag for the accessories . it 's nice and sturdy . it has 3 separated pockets inside which i just realized today . & # 128512 ; . bag is big enough to fit the given attachments perfectly . 
sorry . have n't tried it yet . 
have n't tried . 
absolutely ! 
i have n't done that yet , but i imagine if you do it long enough without your arm wearing out it would do the job ... .. 
yes , this model did . 
i only have the wet food blade container . but i have used it for things such as grinding peanuts into peanut butter . i have not tried coffee beans into grounds since the quanity one would have to grind would be too much anyway . personally , i would get the mixer ( it is really good ) and wait on getting the dry container . you may find you are happy without it . you can also look directly on the vita mix web site for some video tutorials . they show the dry container there too and what they do with it . 
no , this one not including dry at all . if you want dry you pay extra 120 more 
yes , it does ! you have to register your blender on the vitamix website , but its easy . 
did n't know about the recall and have not been notified . we use it every day and have had no issues . i will check the blade dates tonight to make sure . 
this is the pro 300 
yes . since it 's variable speed , it 's trial and error for a few times . does a great job with daiquiris 
hi - you did not mention the height of each layer , but for an overall 3.5 '' - 4 '' cake height , you would need 2 sheets . the sheets we received were 8.5 '' x 11 '' , not as the stated quarter sheet size ( which would be 9 '' x 13 '' ) . i hope this helps . if you have any other questions , feel free to contact us ! ! 
the sheet was only about the size of an 8 by 10 sheet of paper . i had bought 2 because i was n't sure either . the cake i was doing was an 8 inch round and ended up just using one sheet cut in half using a box cutter . i butted the two strips to go around the cake sides . whimsical practicality or leanza 's bakery site where this sugar sheet came from has a sugar sheet chart giving approximately how many to use for different size cakes that might help you some . 
very thin . i 'd say less than 1 8 '' . but i 'm just guessing . another way to say is probably a bit thicker than paper . 
yes it will . i used this on an 8 inch round cake 
i bought 5 to be on the safe side , just in case i was to mess one up . these sheets you have to be very careful or they will rip very easy . 
the box is pretty big so i do n't think so . i use my own containers . i like the cooler . it 's my second one . 
yes . 
china , like everything else i guess . had it for 6 months no complaints 
no , it 's plastic . i love it ! 
i do n't see why you could n't but are you aware that a lot of teas should never be put into boiling water ? a lot of teas actually are recommended to be done at lower temperatures . i 'm not trying to solicit but i am part of a company that does sell loose leaf tea and there is a tea app if you have an apple or android cell phone that you can download for free . go to your app store and look up tealightful it has a lot of great information about all types of tea . 
i got this product like 2 months already and so far it did not rust yet . 
do not know for sure , but it is stainless steel with a plastic window . 
it is stainless steel the only plastic on it is the little window and the handle . it is a hard plastic of a type that i would not think had bpa . 
it 's fast ! ! ! 
through the base that has a wire ... the kettle sits on the base and and gets power through the contacts . 
i believe it is 64 ounces . 
yes , as pictured , the lid holds the infusing ice cube column . 
i handwash it with some liquid soap , like dawn , or palmolive , etc . and it cleans very well . i would n't put it in a dishwasher , as it may damage it . 
plastic . 
dear , you do not need to put a duvet over it , the silk is more than 2 lb , and all the silk comforter is about 6 lb 
the tag on my mulberry silk comforter says : do not wash ; spot clean only ; do not bleach ; do not tumble dry ; dry in shade ; iron low heat ; do not dry clean . 
dear , you need to add a duvet cover to this silk comforter , then you can wash the duvet cover , thanks 
dear , king size is 102-inch by 89-inch , queen size is 92-inch by 89-inch 
dear , king size is 102-inch by 89-inch , queen size is 92-inch by 89-inch 
only a head board , not a foot 
not to my knowledge , unless there is an additional kit . i suggest asking the manufacturer . 
it held my queen size box spring and mattress without any problem . the construction is much sturdier than my old bed frame . 
i do not think it is that loud . no more than any other . we make two loaves of french bread a week , it does work the machine , but mixes well and the bowl is big enough to keep the dough inside . i tried this machine for the price and i am pleased with it . i use it about every other day with something and i would purchase it again when i wear this one out . 
yes it have the attachment gear socket but the meat grinder and pasta roller can not came with the machine . 
i do n't know but this beast is great and this three accessories is enough , i have used this in two months like 20 times and for the first time in my bakery life i could make buttercream in dominican republic . it worth more than it cost for me the accessories are great and theu are not plastic . 
yes it 's close to the bottom , it works good , just a little loud when you use the balloon whisk , but when you use the other whisk , it is n't as loud , i like this mixer , i make alot of icing without having any problem . 
that is a fairly relative question . some consider hand mixers and submersion mixers to be loud . this is a powerful mixer - made for heavy loads - so i imagine it would disturb a sleeping cat - let 's put it that way . but it is stable on the table . 
that does n't coincide with what ours does . it was on continuously , until it reached the level we selected ( started at 65 ) , then it would go on and off as needed . 
i would visit this website and you will find the manual http : www.sunpentown.com sd50pidewibu.html 
you have to build a special bracket for it . the plastic shell will not be able to support its own self weight . 
did you try washing it first ? this is info on downloaded manual ... .sunpentown international inc. 14625 clark ave , city of industry , ca 91745 tel : 1-800-330-0388 service @ sunpentown.com www.sunpentown.com 
the book does n't say . i would think 6 or 7 feet would be fine , though . the previous dehumidifier that i owned could lift 13 feet . 
specs say 4.7a with starting current of 22a 
it is made in china . 
i had no problem with noise from the unit . even slept with it in a small bedroom and was surprised i did n't notice it after a short while . it is rated for 800 square ft. which meant i had to move it around until the problem resolved , but that was my fault for not paying attention to the details . otherwise very pleased with the product . hope this helps . 
it takes the same filter as the aqua-ionizer deluxe 7.0 and the akkah2o kei 501. it currently sells for $ 39.95 . it 's located here http : www.amazon.com gp product b00ae8bues 
hi misty : not sure which white colored model you are talking about ? however , this is the only 7 plate ionizer at this price point . the alkaexpress kei 701 comes with a 60 day money back guarantee to allow you to test it to your satisfaction ! 
thanks for your question . they are solid . 7 plates of platinum coated titanium . 
it is made in china . 
they are manufacturered in china by a company that has been in business for over 20 years . along with water ionizers they manufacturer water treatment plants ro drinking water systems , standard water filters , water coolers and more . 
i think they are rather large . nice size for a bag of flour and or sugar . they are a deep red . i do not see pink at all . hope this helps . 
they are ceramic and i love mine !

yes , all the lids have a rubber seal on them . 
hi , approximately 10 tablespoons of loose leaf tea are a good measure for brewing a gallon of tea . currently , this is the only size tea infuser we offer . since our infuser holds about 1 1 2 tablespoons , depending on which tea variety you use , it would take you about 6-7 filling brewing times with our infuser to make a gallon . hope this is helpful , especially for making iced tea as summer approaches ! warmly , bridgett from flourish & thrive 
yes..the finer ones will leak through a bit . this does n't bother me too much because i tend to use a larger cut leaf . 
hi megan , the materials are made in china and we assemble and pack them here in nc , usa . thanks , bridgett 
hi karen , yes , the silicone is bpa-free . we will likely be adding this information to our packaging in the future . thanks , bridgett from flourish & thrive 
definitely not . 
the unit comes with food grade stainless steel 1 4 '' hole shelving , which works great for dehydrating any kind of fruit or veggie slices . if you are making fruit leathers , raw cookies , or anything that starts out as a liquid you would need to purchase sheets . silicone sheets can be purchased on our website . or you can use baking parchment paper : ) 
hello , thank you for your question . our dehydrators are warrantied against faulty workmanship and defects for 1 year from purchase . our dehydrators will be repaired or replaced at discretion of raw rutes , llc . 
the fan is located along the rear wall of the unit . the noise level is quieter than most of our stainless steel competitors we tested against . we have noticed that some of the plastic units may be slightly quieter , but by design they are less efficient at removing moisture . honestly , to the average ear , it would n't even be noticeable : ) the best way i can describe it is as a low hum . 
the colors are very similar to the picture : dark brown , brown , old rose , dark wine , white , black , small gold details . very nice ! 
the screws and holder were easy to attach to the middle of each frame . we used pencil to mark off the top of each picture and used our own nails in the wall . the different sections are light to hang . 
no 
no , it comes with the hardware in a bag , you have to attach it all yourself . 
no 
yes ebay , bought 1 
i never looked for a cover , but probably easy to make one . i would use a king size sheet & go from there . 
no 
do n't know exact limit ... but we 've had a guest sleep on it that is probably 250. they loved it ! we frequently all sit on it to play video games which exceeds the 250 lbs total . it seems very durable . 
do n't really know , but the cot fit nicely inside . we saved the box to slide over the top when we store the cot . 
it 's a tad bit smaller than a twin size , but the quality is outstanding ! 
correct , this line of cookware is made of 18 10 stainless steel ! 
this set is induction compatible , it works on all types of induction cooktops including nuwave . 
no , i always heat up first if sauting then add oil ... . nothing sticks . i love the set ! 
china 
no they do not . 
i have a glass top range and it works great with the cookware . 
because the duxtop cookware contains ferromagnetic materials - in other words , it contains iron , or has a layer with magnetic properties . an easy way to tell whether a cookware is induction capable is to contact it with a magnet . if it does n't attract the magnet , it is not induction capable . 
china 
no , it is stainless steel but not durable enough for oven or stove top use . i also do n't put mine in the dishwasher . it is best washed in warm , soapy water . all that said , i really love this product ! it is durable for its intended use , and well worth its cost . 
no 
yes 
i have had mine for many months now and have had no rust problems . i do make sure it is not sitting in water for any period of time however . 
i have an 'easy lunchbox ' tote . the lunchbots container fits in it perfectly . you can definitely fit a regular size water bottle or even a small thermos for drink . we use them daily . 
i use cold packs in the lunch bag with the lunch bot and it stays very cold . my kids have loved them . 
brushed metal . 
the back is thick cardboard . the front side ( the side that you will see if you open drawers and in the exposed spaces ) is `` finished '' - it matches the color of the unit . the back side of the cardboard is not . 
43 7 8 '' wide , 18 1 8 '' deep , 41 5 8 '' tall 
parts are veneer and parts are engineer wood 
no , this particular style only comes in this color . 
omigosh hours of assembly with at least a few broken pieces ! 
hi kamlyn ! i 've had soup stay really hot for 3 hours , and nicely hot for 5 hrs . ( indoors ) i have n't used it for picnics or camping , so i do n't know how well it insulates when it 's used outside . hope this helps ! 
unfortunatley , i do not recall . however i can tell you that it is poorly made . i bought if for my 1o year old son . he is pretty good about not breaking things , but the the plastic handles are really poorly designed and broke within 2 weeks . if it is for an adult , it might last longer . 
it 's about 6 inches tall when stacked and about 6 inches in diameter . 
i 'm sorry unfortunately it is not 
i never tried to use it for that purpose . only used it for my son 's school lunch 's . 
yes , same size . 
stacked , the container is a little under 6 '' high . the two bowls have a diameter of about 5 '' . it has worked fairly well for my son 's ( 13 yrs ) lunches , but i 've had to wrap his sandwiches in cellophane or aluminum foil so that the rest of the compartment can hold something else . 
i have n't tried but i 'm scared of carcinogens in plastic so i never heat plastic stuff 
no 
no more than any other dish one would put in the microwave . 
i do n't have a scale for small weights , but the plates are substantial . i 'm 70 and in pretty good shape , and find them manageable . btw , i like this set very much ! 
yes 
i used the box springs that we had . i just put a piece of 1 2 '' plywood on top of the box sprngs . works great . hope this helps you . 
yes . you can use this mattress with an adjustable bed base . 
we have regular deep pocket sheets and they work just fine on ours . 
yes also if you go to walmart and buy a 4inch piece of memory foam and replace the two pads that come with it , it makes a very comfortable bed for $ 140 more 
it is a flat bed . does not incline . 
it is fairly quiet and runs only a short time to adjust to whatever setting you want . 
if you live in the state of fl you will be charged sales tax . 
ours appeared to be new with new packaging . i really do n't believe it was a demo . and we 're loving the bed . it was pretty easy to set up as well . 
i made egg muffins this morning and the recipe called for measuring the batter as one-third of a cup per muffin indentation ; that worked perfectly with this silicone pan . 
the one i just received says `` made in china '' . 
hi big t ... yes its pba free and we use silicone that is lfgb certified which is higher then fda certified , its actually a european standard which for whatever reason is higher . please let us know if we can answer any other questions . 
no , i did n't 
i little rough ... but it is amazing product . no complains 
granite : ) 
i took an uncooked white rice and over a period of several weeks i would crush the rice against the inner bowl . it takes a while , and some rice will jump out on to the table , or floor . i spent around 10 minutes per day , and i noticed the rice crushed easier on the second day . this method worked well but was time-consuming . 
unfortunately the origin of the stone is not listed on the box , literature or stone itself . it is manufactured in china . 
assume you are asking about the poles that go in the corners . i made my own by cutting pvc pipe to length and stitched 1 side that they slide in to 
no mine have not pilled . 
yes they are . they are great sheets so far . held up after washing , and have a nice soft feel . 
they will work without the polls but i strongly recommend getting the polls your sheets will never pull loose again 
microfiber 
300 and very soft just realize they do not have the stay poles . 
there is a flap in each corner of the sheet that a short pole slides into and then is tucked under the waterbed mattress . this will help keep the sheets in place ... .. 
plastic 
it is 36 '' w x 28.4 '' d x 21.4 '' h . 
the table is too small for 6 children but 4 young children can sit comfortably . 
the minimum height is 24 inches from the floor to the seat 
i am 6'2 '' and weigh 280 # they handle me very well 
i purchased four of these several months ago . assembly was a breeze and the instructions were simple . they 've been used a lot and still look new . 
approximately 15 pounds 
the seat is 17 '' wide,15 '' deep and 3 '' thick . the back is 17 '' wide x 12 '' high and is 2 '' thick . the side arms are one unit assembly , removable , attached by two screws under the seat . the stool is comfortable and good looking . is 
all i remember is that the black pieces that look like caps are supposed to come off . i had to pry them off . 
the height is about 6 3 4 '' . 
no 
i do n't know about etchingthe cup . i do know one of them cracked on the inner glass . i 'm just waiting for the other one to do the same . not a great item 
was too tall for my nespresso machine ... 
yes , it is bpa free -- it is glass , not polycarbonate . as stated in the description : borosilicate glass is both food and dishwasher safe 
not at all , no 
yes . i 've reheated my tea , often in the microwave , while using this double walled glass cup . 
4 '' wide by 8 '' tall . width of the mouth ( open ) 2 3 4 '' 
8in tall , 4in wide and 13in around . it holds more food than i need for a filling lunch . 
china 
no . i doesnt 
yes depending on the size of your hand 
noise is relative thing . my first unit was noisier than i would tolerate and i sent it back . the 2nd unit was considerably better , not as quiet as some reviews would leave you thinking . your mileage may vary . 
530 watt 
it should be ok 
yes . i installed it through the wall . 
you are not able to close the vents completely . 
yes it does . 
thanks for your question . as we get the rest in stock they should be listed . likely over the next week and a half or so . 
black.. definitely black.. 
i 'm 6'1 180lbs and would n't mind sharing this.. but it would be a bit intimate . similar to a twin bed , but a bit longer ( my feet do n't hang off the edge on this ) . 
pretty decent mattress 
hi , here are the exact measurements : futon dimensions : 73.5 '' l x 37.5 '' w x 32.5 '' h lounger dimensions : 73 '' l x 46 '' w x 33 '' h sleeper dimensions : 73.5 '' l x 46 '' w x 14.5 '' h seat height from floor : 14.5 '' hope this helps ... thanks ! ! 
the glass is 12.5 ounces . 
absolutely ! the glasses are dishwasher-safe . 
thank you for your interest . national etching does not offer this glass with a pink stem at this time . 
no , this glass does not `` rn '' on it anywhere . 
national etching uses a price-banded shipping model . up to $ 40 of goods is a flat $ 5.95 shipping . 
i would direct your question to amazon customer service - national etching has limited visibility into the amazon shipping process . we are merchant fulfilling this item as well and do ship within 24 hours via usps priority . 
thank you for your interest ! national etching is restricted from offering customized products on the amazon platform . 
comes nicely packed in a box . 
i am assuming they are made of some sort of plastic , but on the outside of the box they came in was a sign that said no bpa . hope this helps . 
they are not designed to withstand the `` heat '' of a microwave . i use glassware in the microwave . 
no , the colanders have small handles to lift them from the bowls . the lids fit the bowls . 
yes -- from the amazon page : pros : * 3 convenient bowl sizes ( 5.5 quart , 3 quart , 1.5 quart ) in 3 different colors , making it super easy to grab matching pieces * easy to stack pieces , both in the cabinet and in the fridge with lids on * well balanced bowls with non-slip bottoms * bowls and colanders are dishwasher safe ( see associated fyi below ) * light weight , yet sturdy , plastic ( ? ) material & bowls have tight fitting lids , making them perfect for travel and fridge storage ( see con & fyi below ) * no bpas 
i can only speak from my experience & unfortunately the answer is yes . i only had the kettle for a little over a month & it rusted on me was very disappointed faberware really needs to take this one back to the drawing board . hope this helps i recommend you keep shopping . 
yes 
on the box it says it 's manufactured in vellejo , california . 
copper is better for it heats more quickly . other than that they are pretty much the same . 
it 's been a while since i bought it but i think i recall it being in its own box . 
the tea kettle comes in retail packaging ... . 
yes . 
it 's approximately 12 '' x9 '' x4 '' 
2 pin 
turn knob on right ... ... ... ... .heater is cheap made ... .if you have not bought it ... ..do n't 
i use it in the bathroom more than any other room . just be careful to place it so that it is out of the way . away from any chance of getting wet or being in your path of entry or exit . 
yes 
the model number is so136a for which i received in february , 2014 . 
hi , yes we have a reduced shipping rate for each additional poster that you purchase . please see our shipping fees page . 
if you choose the expedited shipping option we ship through the usps and the usps says it should reach you in 3-5 business days . if you just choose regular shipping it will be more like 5-7 business days . postal transit times can be greatly affected by weather and distance . please keep in mind that we ship from rural texas . hope that helps answer your question . 
i lined them with plastic wrap and filled them with water just to the bottom of the metal retaining band . here is what i got : large : 4 cups medium : 2 cups small : 1 4 cup 
thank you for your question . the diameter of the largest strainer is 7-7 8-inch . i hope to have informed you sufficiently . best wishes , all times finest 
dear happy reader , that is a good question . the lengths of the strainers given in the description excludes the lengths of the handle . the diameters are given in the description , however the lengths of the handles are 6 '' , 5.5 '' and 4.6 '' respectively from large to smallest . hope this answers your question . if not , just let us know and we will elaborate further . 
we had to test this out ourselves , but unfortunately this is not the case . the grain size of ground coffee can be compared to that of flour . there are hardly any strainers that are fine enough to strain coffee . most people use a coffee filter inside these strainers to make sure it does n't fall through . 
actually , this why i bought it , to rinse my quinoa . so just to confirm the mesh is fine enough that it will not fall through . 
these strainers are made in china and shipped to the usa . 
of the largest strainer the depth is 2.5 inches . 
just an fyi , there are 3 settings on this heater , hi , lo , & eco . i have four of these types of heater this being one of them and i have a `` kill a watt '' meter that i have run test on all of them . this listing on this heater shows it has three wattages using the 1500w , 750w , and 500w . this is not true , and in the manufactures ' specs ( being fair to the manufacture ) it says nothing about the eco being 500w . i believe some one that was trying to sell this heater made up the 500w setting and some others read it and decided to add it to their description . it runs in only two wattages , hi runs approximately 1240w , lo runs about 870w and eco runs both hi and lo . how eco works is a fixed setting of 68 degrees , when the temp in the room is 65 degrees or lower the heater will run at the hi setting until it is within 2 degrees of the fixed setting then it kicks into lo mode and runs at that setting until the 68 degree mark is reached . i personally have discovered there is no real use for the eco setting since i like to run the heater on lo mode ( being the most economical ) most of the time . hope this help explain the heater , btw after the entire test my show a cost of roughly $ 16.00 a month at my cost of $ 0.09 per kwh at 8 hours a day usage . 
yes , if the kids are touching the top or sides . they can not touch the heating elements in the front ... it will burn them . so , if you have a toddler.. do not get it . if you have older kids who follow directions and know to not touch the front where the heat comes out ... . then get it . 
no , it does n't turn off , it resumes once power is back . 
yes , it is 110 volts and works on normal outlet . it take 15 amps though . 
yes it has rollers 
cycles when heating . 
600 
sure you can place anywhere . for small room this heater is life saver . it saves on gas bill . i never get nasal conjestion with this heater . outside of heater never gets hot . it is worth buying , great money saver never to worry about boiler repair or worry about plumber . so many benefits . for big room it may not be very very effective.. amiongest all model of lifesmart this is most economical , i have one with flam more expensive and gives less heat , so buy this model .i have 6 of this type of heaters i am using in all rooms when we are using these rooms , like our bedrooms my daughter bedroom lining room etce very rarely we start main heating system

it could , but i use distilled water so i do n't have the white build up . i clean it about once a month and i use it almost daily . 
yes i do all the time 
yup ! gives two little beeps to let you know it 's out , then shuts off . 
china 
it 's plastic . you can pick a single color or let it cycle through all of them . 
you can not dim it , but you can turn the light on or leave it off . 
i love my nascco - it does what i expected and is more then i expected as well . it is a cube about 7 '' w x 7 '' d and is about 5 '' h. filled it runes for about 12 hours . i hope this is helpful . 
i gave the set as a gift , but my guess is that the glasses are 10-12 oz . the decanter should hold a normal sized bottle of liquor 
dear tessa if you place an order anytime from now until 3pm est on wednesday 10 15 it will ship out on 10 15. we use ups ground for this shipment . i believe the travel time is 3 days . if you want further help or have questions , please call our office anytime after 7:30am est and we can help you . 866-495-4521. thank you , alan schneider , crystalizeonline.com 
lots of bubble wrap ! each glass is individually wrapped . i would n't worry about it getting damaged while being shipped . they really take lots of measures to ensure the package arrives in tact . 
yes , this set can be monogrammed ; however , this is not a service that we are set up to offer on amazon.com . 
i gave one to my son and son in law for christmas so i have n't seen it since then but it is about 12 inches tall give or take an inch with it 's stopper . 
i seem to remember the instructions saying not to , but i have run it in the dishwasher every once and a while 
no , i bought a bed frame made for this product . reasonably cheap , much less than a box spring 
it does 
yes . i placed mine on top of my old box spring and its just fine . 
this is in my guest room and so far no one has slept on it . 
i do n't think i saw a warranty document with the package per se - but you can buy this without any hesitation . i 've had it for about 4 months now and have absolutely no complaints . just make sure you allow it to expand to its normal size for a day before you begin to use it 
yes you can . it 's the best popcorn maker we have ever had . 
we like it . it is however our second one - the handle came off and the glass then fell and broke on the previous one . we decided to try again because of the different handle on the new one . we really like the popcorn it makes . 
the first one i owned of these the handle fell off . it was a glasss handle . i was foolish enough to buy another one 10 years later hoping the handle problem had been addressed . so i thought since they changed to a silicone handle maybe they had fixed the problem . i see they have not . my main problem with this popper this time is that i did n't like the way the popcorn tasted after popping it . i only used it twice and gave it to goodwill . i did not use it enough to wait for the handle to fall off . even if you found another handle i do n't know how you would attach it . whatever way the manufacturer is attaching is not working so i do n't think anyone else could do it either . 
yes 
bennington , vt 
seven and a half inches high and ten inches across the jug + handle 
no , it 's glass and silicone . designed for microwave use . 
no lids but i was looking and think you can buy them separately 
yes , i use them on my glass smooth surface cooktop 
no they will not . they are aluminum . induction cooktops rely on magnetism to work and so will only work with steel or iron pans . 
i checked with the macy 's rep , and he told me calphalon uses other ones , not a dupoint made i know anolon does = ) 
i own calphalon and swear by it 's durability and even cooking on all surfaces . i would recommend it . 
they do with proglonged high heat so i use potholder mitt . you can purchase protective heat proof slide on handle to place on handles & they work fine . great pans regardless . 
no 
no just 2 
about 0.8 inches , they hold 1 8 cup 2 tbs 30 ml 
1 8 cup 2 tbs 30 ml 
hi tina . no , it 's only available in 12-cup . thanks . suzanne . 
around 1 2 to 3 4 of inch 
i have not had to grease mine . i love this pan and have used it several time for things other than muffins . 
i do n't know . i have looked for this information but ca n't find it . sorry ! 
yes it is ! 
no it does n't . it also has a small logo on it for some company . 
there is a low carb setting , and there is a recipe for low carb seed bread . you could use other recipes with that setting . 
it has two . 
to keep the paddles from sticking , i always drop a teaspoon or , truth be told , even a tablespoon of oil on each paddle before i place the first ingredients into the pan . then , after baking , if the paddles still stick , i lay the hot pan on its side ( holding it with kitchen mitts ) and wiggle the undersides of the paddles until they spin . at that point , i can turn the pan upside down and the loaf falls out onto the cutting board without a problem . let me know if this works for you , too . 
yes , there is a gluten free setting and one recipe in the book . however , this is my fourth bread maker and i do not like it so would suggest you look into machines . hope this helps . 
if you are referring to the holes left by the paddles , there is no way that i know of . as to removal from the pan , i run a spatula around the entire pan -- inserting it all the way to the bottom of the pan . 
not very bright at all , but a nice machine . recipes are a bit different , and i have n't had much luck converting recipes from my 1 1 2 pound bread machine . might be error on my part . i do love the 3 lb capacity . 
the paddley can only be put on the shafts in one position because the shafts are shaped to fit the inside shape of the paddles . you can position them any way you wish . i usually put them so they are at opposite positions corner to corner . using a map reference , one is pointed nne and the other ssw . that is the best way to get good mixing action in the dough . 
nope . put in a long sheetrock screw and hang the vacuum on that . 
no 
we use it regularly to clean the car . the only problem is its a little heavy , and of course , you have to charge up the battery following the cleaning . because its a little bulky , hard to get under the seats , etc . works great in the trunk . has enough suction power to deal with most stuff . 
it comes with a small crevice attachment 
no , its a single speed ... ..but works great . runs on a battery that is easy to charge . unit is easy to clean , and reassemble . i have other b & d tools which use the same battery , which is a plus . 
i purchased it several months ago and have been really happy with the quality . i have a large microwave and other items bottles etc on it and have had no problems at all . 
i do n't know yet , i got on of the few left before they sold out . i always go into these projects hopeful ... we 'll see . i 'll update when i have tackled the assembly 
we had no issues with any scent . it did take a few days to fully expand at the corners , but we 're very happy with it , especially for the price . it 's a guest bed for us and so far it 's been received very well .

thanks for your question ! this mattress is made from 3 layers of high density memory foam . there is a 5 inch layer of high density therapeutic foam , a 2.5 inch support layer of high density memory foam and the top layer is a 2.5 inch layer of gel infused memory foam . unfortunately i do n't have the exact density of each layer but 'high density ' would mean 6 pounds per cubic foot or higher . i hope this helps ! 
do n't know the exact weight but feels like 15- 20 pounds inflated . 
i purchased the queen size version but i do believe there is a full size version . the dimension of the full size version i do not know . do you want the dimensions of the queen size version ? 
about as good as any we 've owned . 
this is primarily what i use mine for ( i 'm not ashamed to admit it ) . the only downside is that with the wider slots , the poptarts get a little bowed in the middle the longer they are toasted . obviously , this does n't affect the taste at all . : ) 
yes . 
no , it is not unfortunately . the bottom of the toaster has brackets that you can manually wind the cord around , but the toaster wo n't always sit flat . i also have an oster toaster that has a retractable cord which i love . it costs about $ 5 more that the hamilton beach . 
yes , it is very lightweight .

barn wood , fencing , construction sites and pallets . 
i drilled it into the wall . i just used screws and found the stud in the wall and it 's very sturdy . i love this wine rack , 
i do n't know ... i gave it away as a gift but you can contact the guy who makes them and ask ! 
$ 99 plus $ 27 to ship lower 48 usa 
send us the size you are looking for . the stain color and the zip code for shipping . we will send u a quote based on that . thanks for looking . jim millen great lakes 
no it will not . you would have to order our liquor rack whiskey rack which will allow for the larger bottles . jim 
overall width is 4-5 inches the inside wine bottle width is 3.25-3.5 inches . jim 
40 inches long x 17-18 inches high . we do custom lengths to fit whatever your application is . jim 
in each of the four open shelf areas there are two circles in the back of the cabinet that can be pushed out to allow wires and cables to pass through to the outlets behind the cabinet . each circle is an inch to an inch and a half in diameter . i hope this is helpful . 
light grey . i luv it ! ! ! 
the overall width of this unit is 51 inches . 
17 1 2 '' 
the height of the stand is 51 '' 
22 '' wide by 11.5 '' high 
i 'm not sure , but , honestly , this pillow was flat and lumpy within less than a month . if you have back and neck problems to begin with , i do n't recommend this pillow . 
one pillow . 
yes it is waterproof . keep in mind that it is very thin but totally waterproof 
so far , it 's been great for my four year old . he 's had a few accidents while it 's been on the bed and nothing has gotten through to the mattress . 
i felt more at ease putting them to bed knowing that the mattress would n't be wet in the morning . for me , it did help with bedwetting and potty training . 
they are 4.25 '' tall . 
these are great ! no plastic smell or taste and double walked so they keep the white wine cold . 
these are clear plastic . seriously great `` glasses '' ... highly recommend them . 
the packaging says `` up to 17oz '' 
the rim is rounded . the glass has a nice feel in your hand . we have gotten compliments on them . they also clean up great in the top rack of the dishwasher . pretty good product for the money . 
17 
yes they are a bit better because they really can be washed in the upper rack of the dishwasher without warping - the govino warps on the upper rack . 
they are 1 16 '' thick . 
8 '' fills it . the shells are n't very large when done , but not too bad . 
each tortilla takes about 3 minutes . 
this machine runs on 120volts . if you are an international buyer , you will need a converter for this machine . 
use a medium sized tortilla , and it will measure : 6 '' wide at the top , 4 '' wide at the bottom , and 2 '' deep . the fried shells are , of course tastier , but these are pretty darn good , and better for you . bake a minute longer than it says to . 
hi ! thank you for your note . we get many questions like this from all over the world . these nostalgia machines are all made for 120volts . you will need a voltage converter to run the macgine safely . we always recommend that you go to your local electronics store and find a convertor that will work best for your country . i wish we had them in 220. everyone loves the machines ! they are so clever and handy ! please let us know if we can help you further ... caren 
possibly , but i do not think i would try it . the tortilla 's are already made and this just forms to the bowl . 
yes - however - the switch to turn it on is located on the right side of the mirror towards to bottom . so if you rotate it 90 degrees just make sure you recognize the on switch would now be at the bottom of the unit on the left side . 
it has to be recessed some because of the electric housing - it could n't be recessed all the way flush with the wall though . 
needs to be wired to buildings commercial power , just like an overhead or permanent light fixture 
cool 
i 'd say at least twice the size of the one you can get at target . one thing that 's also very nice is that it 's the height of a regular chair , not a lawn chair . i love it . 
black ! ! ! ! ! ! 
not really . but i 'd say 250 lbs max . 
yes 
it has pizza , entree , potato , rice , veggie and sensory reheat 
i do n't believe so 
pressing start cooks for 30 sec . there is also one button cooking by pressing 1-6 for ea respective nmbr of minutes 
20 1 2 in . wide , 15 in . deep , 13 in . high 
how comfortable is it for an adult ? i weight 186 lbs 
the box says 225 pounds ( we 've had heavier people use them with no problem though ) 
i 'm not familiar with oroweat . but i know the schmidt 's king bread fits perfectly within the grid , but i have used oblong sourdoughs and other breads it just goes outside the grid a little but still inside the machine . it 's a great machine . 
plug it in 
you plug it in its on , you unplug it it 's off . this is by far one of the best sandwich makers i have every purchased . ca n't go wrong ! 
you plug it in . the lights change colour when it 's up to temperature - perhaps that is it 's only weakness ? you ca n't leave it unattended . 
no 120 
no , only us voltage . but ! it is a wonderful tool .

yes , it does 
yes it does . it is a pretty slick product . i am impressed with it , and the espresso machine , compared to what i get at places like starbucks . there are certainly better lattes to be had at high end coffee houses , but these are good products . 
no , you have to buy their pods ( and they 're not the standard size that go into k-cup machines ) . so , make sure you look at the price of those pods and factor that into your decision . it turns out to be kind of pricey ; on the other hand , the coffee is excellent . 
they make things . dark things . evil things . this-coffee-doesn't-taste-very-good things . you can use them to disappoint yourself and everyone you love to produce substandard beverages using your own grinds through the nespresso machine . i 'd rather get a christmas stocking full of dead hamsters than a cup of coffee made with self-provided grinds in a nespresso machine . but then , maybe other people like dead hamsters . 
it would really depend on how heavy the person using the bed is . remember there is no box spring the mattress is held up by narrow metal slats . certainly would n't let kids jump on it 
hi , i have a tempur-pedic mattress on it which is quite thick . it 's larger than the standard coil mattress in thickness . it reaches to to the bottom of the low section of the frame 's arms . 
i 'm not sure . i do n't recall seeing it in the instructions . we had 3 adults sitting on it and it was fine . i would recommend getting a `` bunkie board '' or maybe a piece of plywood to put under the mattress . overall it 's a great bed and i was happy with the purchase . 
i think you could because the base of the bed sits pretty high up from the ground . in fact you probably would have a significant space between the trundle and the bed i bet . 
it has been released from the panasonic brand of japan after being manufactured in china . 
yes 
yes . 
only japanese language 
yes . 
made in china 
the cord storage compartment is 10 1 4 x 2 1 4 inches , the front compartment for brushes , etc. , is 6 3 4 x 4 inches , the blow dryer insert is 2 3 4 inches , the curling iron insert is 1 3 4 inches , and the flattening iron insert is 2 1 4 x 2 1 4 inches . 
the organizer does not have a power strip attached , but one could be installed on the base or inside the cord storage bin . most homes do not have an electrical outlet inside the vanity cabinet , but you could have an electrician install one . 
you can wrap them or use the available slot in the front to store them , which is what we do with ours . 
hello jb , the organizer has 3 steel inserts for hot appliances , one for a hair dryer , one for a curling iron , and one for a flattening iron . 
hello carolyn , the dimensions of the organizer are 18 3 4 inches long or deep , 9 1 2 inches wide and 7 inches tall . allow enough room for tall appliances like curling irons , 17 or so inches . 
thanks for your question , this item is currently unavailable- we do n't know when or if this item will be back in stock . as such , we can not predict what the cost would be should we receive this item in the future . i hope this helps ! 
the organizer has a clear finish applied , it is not possible to stain it although it could possibly be painted . 
the mats arrive rolled on a cardboard tube and quickly lay flat after you put them down on the floor . 
i suppose so , but it really shines for standing and making small steps like you do in front of a sink or a washing machine . 
it 's about 5 8 '' thick . very well cushioned and comfortable for standing at sink or range . 
tight fit 
yes it is great for an office with limited space . only wish it was a little bigger inside . can drinks fit perfect and keeps them cold . i have had no problems and have had it for almost a year . 
it is about 13 inches high , 12 inches deep ( from front to back ) and 12 inches wide . these are approx . dimensions for i threw the box away ! the inside dimensions are 9 inches high , 8 inches wide and 6 inches deep . the directions said to turn it off every 2 days for 1 hour , but someone wrote in and said his has been plugged in for a year and he never unplugged it at all and it works just fine . i bought this for my kindergarten classroom to keep my water and lunch cold . i hope this helps . 
do n't know the measurements . gave mine away . i could fit 5 or 6 bottles in there . 
13 '' hx11 1 2 '' wx 12 1 2 '' d 
yes a standard water bottle will easily fit 
the dimensions of this mattress are 5 '' x 39 '' x 75 '' . 
twin 
about 20lbs . do not buy this . the description is horribly innacurate . it is far from a mattress ... more of a pad , in three sections , connected by fabric hinges . 
in product description it says 18 lbs ? i do n't even think it 's that much ... it seems like it was very light ? but do n't want to take off the bed to see . sorry . 
no 
its like a metal basket- it 's really cute 
it is black as shown . 
1 cup ( 8oz . ) 
i have not had a problem with ants . i would assume if you keep the little opening on the side closed you would not have a problem . 
it 's a quality product and would not break if dropped on the carpet . much better look and feel vs the regular one made by the supermarket brand . 
i do n't see why not ! 
pretty sure the lid would be ... i 'm not sure about the spout ... in the closed position , when shaken upside down , not a grain of sugar sneaks out . i like this sugar dispenser . ( and the similar s & p shakers . ) 
it holds about a cup perhaps a little more . i love it . it 's so convenient ! 
it holds one cup . 
made in india 
no it 's not ... it 's the same material as outside ! 
yes i have the bowls and they do nest for storage but with the lids off of course which need to be stored seperatly . 
no , the cover is not a good fit . it wo n't hold anything liquid . overall , i 'm not happy with the design . because of the loose fitting lid , the food does not only leak but cools rather quickly . 
no these dishes are not dishwasher safe . they will expand and come apart in the dishwasher . 
yes no sound at all unless you put the fan on 
no , broken 
worst customer service and horrible experience - not the answer you were looking for - but still the truth 
according to the manual , the fan is 55w , and the cool mist humidifier is 35w . they can be run together or separately . 
it is 62 inches by 96 inches . 
over prices very cheaply made sent mine back . not worth $ 27 do n't do it . 
the fitted sheet is designed to fit a twin xl mattress of size 39 x 80 inches ( 99 x 203 cm ) . 
the fitted sheet is designed to fit a twin xl mattress of size 39 x 80 inches ( 99 x 203 cm ) . 
this sheet set is a blend of cotton and polyester . cotton 60 % and polyester 40 % . 
yes , by remote control ( if you lose the remote control like i did , then no ) . timer is in increments , for example , 15 min. , 30 min. , etc . ca n't set for any oddball time like 3 min. , 17 min. , etc . overall , an excellent fan , as you do n't have to worry about dusty fan blades.. always blows nice cool fresh air . in fact , i 'm using it as i 'm typing this to you . 
i 'm not sure , i do n't work for them . i just purchased one of them a few months back . i works really well , but only has one level setting on the fan itself , i think you can use the remote to turn it up and down , but i 've never used the it . i have it on my desk at work and i like it except for the size , it 's a little big . 
hi , thank you for your question . it uses 110v ac power . it is not usb powered . thank you . 
charger , wall hanger bracket , long rude , floor cleaning head , animal upholstery head , wand ( crevice tool ) , small head with retractable brush . it 's complete . 
1. motoruzed head with carbon fiber filaments 2. mini motoruzed head 3. crevice tool 4. combination assesory tool 5. extension pole 6. charger and charger stand for hanging 
yes it is good on hardwood floors . that is what i have in my house . 
the battery is made of nickel , manganese , cobalt li-ion . it is the earlier one . the dc59 has the new battery . 
i have used it on a low pile carpet and it does work well , however , it will bog down on other thicker carpets and the beater bar will not work . great on hardwood floors . hope this helps . 
full recharge takes about 5-6 hours , if that is what you are referring to in your question . 
yes it works great i love it . 
no , it is slightly tapered like a regular muffin cupcake pan . 
yes ! 
have n't had mine long enough to have this happen . 
from what i can tell , yes . 
i 'm not sure on the exact ounces , but they hold about a quarter cup of liquid so that must be about two ounces . 
one inch deep 
touch button to start , then touch button again to back up and release lid . very sharp edge on lid and can ! ! ! i 've quit using it because of dangerous edges . 
i did n't see warranty info on enclosed safety & use flyer so i emailed the company & here is their response : `` hello , the easican has a 2 year warranty . have a great day , cid : image005.jpg @ 01cfed23.25a23760 , anne marie steele , customer service , dkb household usa corp. , let 's connect on linkedin ! `` . have only had mine a couple of months but works just great so far . hope this helps you . 
approximately 5 '' x 3 '' . works terrific ! 
yes , it is easy to use and seems safer than other types , which require strength and skill . the opener requires the person to shut it off by using the same black button to turn it on before it will stop rotating . 
yes push button once to start push button to stop 
mine wo n't work either . new batteries also . 
hi emma ! we 've only had the zyliss about a month so i ca n't tell you . they do provide the first battery . 
normally 7-15 days to united states , not long time ! please do not worry . 
as a flower , it is roughly 3 '' diameter by 2 '' depth . it depends on how tightly you fold the bag back into it . the bag is roughly 15 1 2 '' wide by 16 1 2 '' deep , not including the handles , which are 1 '' wide and have a loop hang of about 10 '' . to be more precise , i 'd need to iron it and i do n't have time . hope this helps . 
yes , i got 5 bags when i ordered these . 
not at all . the have a hard rubber piece so thr medal is not touching the floor . 
box was 24 '' x24 '' x36 '' for each box containing 2 chairs ( approximately ) 
more than a little but its very quick and you do n't need any tools . the picture on the instructions was n't very good so that was the hardest part - just figuring out how to put them together . once you know how it goes quick . 
yes 
i 'm underweight , so it holds my weight well and you feel at ease ( not worrying about it tilting or collapsing ) , but you do n't get the `` sturdy '' feeling . on the warranty , i think i 'm holding all the papers that came with it , it does n't say anything about warranty , but it does say that you have a 30-day window for requesting replacements for missing damaged parts . 
i have 100 in stock . if you order today the three mats will leave our ohio warehouse tomorrow and they will arrive to you in three business days or less .

hello kris , a steel base , a standard foundation ( not box springs with coils ) and or a platform bed are all ideal bases to go under the memory foam mattress . the harder the surface , the better the memory foam mattress will perform . in short a box spring is not required . just a firm surface to go under the mattress ! hope this helps , steve

the machine comes with a little booklet and a measuring cup . the booklet has some recipes and indicates how many cups you need for each kind of milk . for instance , to make a litre of soy milk , you need one cup and a half ( included measuring cup , not a regular cup ) of soy beans . you can also add less water and have a thicker milk . for almonds you have to add a bit more or you will get watery milk . the booklet helps a lot but with practice you will determine how you like it . 
yes it is . it is very easy to use and makes great milk . the only issue we have is we like to run four batches one right after the other . the previous model would do that with no problem . this one we can only do two one after the other then we have to let it cool completely before we can run the next two . we have also found that we get a higher milk yeald with less waste if we put the finished product through our blendtec blender before we strain the milk . 
yes 
the outside gets warm but not hot . 
you can do both . if you have soaked soy beans , then you select the `` soaked beans '' option ; if not , then select the `` dry beans '' option . both have worked for me well . 
yes . i make a batch a day . but you must clean it immediately . pour and filter the milk , then clean the unit . it is no problem to get at it to clean . 
no 
g4 machine with flowers is smaller than g4 stainless steel . 
yes , but not sure you are aware that once liquid is inside the glass , the chalk on the outside disappears . i returned them once i discovered that.. 
yes they can but they have to be mason jar lids 
i did n't try , but the top appears to allow it : ) 
unfortunately i 'm not finding that this membrane will work with your system . 
hi c. pan : no this membrane will not fit the culligan ac-30 . thank you , waterfiltersonline

no , this is size 1812 ( 12 '' long ) 
it is made of grade 2 titanium 
the straw is approx . 7 and one half inches long . the drinking part is 2 '' . the longer end is 5 1 2 `` long . hope this helps answer your question . 
there 's only one straw . honestly , now that i have it , i do n't regret buying it . i had some stainless steel ones that made drinks with strawberries taste metallic . this one has no `` taste '' to it . 
although i have not used in drinking hot coffee , the manufactured material would handle heat . the metal might heat up a little . i have used with cold coffee and it worked great , no coffee taste residing of course i cleaned first . 
measuring tip to tip it is 7.25 inches . hope that helps . 
1 4 inch in outer diameter 
no 
this will definitely last longer than a plastic straw . i do n't know how long a plastic straw lasts in your house , but in my house a good quality plastic straw is lucky to see 30 uses , even assuming i do n't let the children use it . this straw should last your lifetime . 
it plugs in 
it 's like 6 inches by 12 inches . gf loved it ! 
the trim and the writing are black . 
yes , absolutely yes . 
i sure think these could be trimmed down . after closely looking at then i ca n't imagine why not . go for it ! 
they are 1mm thick , maybe slightly thinner than the more expensive ones . 
we have baked at 500 and had no problems 
i have n't tried it , but it would probably work very well if the size is large enough for your pies . the smallest dimension is 11 5 8 '' inches . there are silicone pastry mats available here on amazon though which are the right dimensions and many even have the round pie markings for easy measurement . 
16-1 2 '' x 11-5 8 '' for each one . 
they are made from bpa free silicone . 
turn them inside out and use a sponge with soapy water . cleans like a breeze and the baked goods slide out of them better than any other brand i 've used ! ! 
standard 2 1 2 '' diameter 
i did the first time , but they said you could just put them on a baking sheet so the second time when i was making 4 mini quiches i just put them on a baking sheet with a rim and they worked perfectly . 
yes , the silicone baking cups can be used in the freezer . i wanted large ice cubes for my pitchers of sweet tea and had no large ice trays . so i filled each cup almost to the top with water , set them on a tray to make carrying them easier , and froze until the cubes were set . the ice-cubes popped right out and looked really cool too ! ! 
i got the king size spread and the shams fit king size bed pillows . this is a great set ! 
the bedspread you are referring to is 100 per cent polyester . 
since i did not need them , i can not remember if there are matching curtains or shears . i dont think so , but i am not positive . sorry . 
the case is sturdy , though it does n't stand as well as shown . the magnet closure is good , but not great . however , that said , it works well , the camera is not obstructed , the color is good and the construction very good . 
no 
i really dont know ... sorry 
i think you will need to find one for the rca 7 '' tablet , as the holes for power and camera would probably be different . this is a great case . we have not had any issues with it at all . good luck . 
you would have to check dimensions of both tablets to decide if it will work with samsung tablet 
depends on what your putting under the bed . you should have around 6-7 inches of clearance under the bed with this frame . hope this helps . 
i do n't have risers on mine , but i would assume for proper support you 'd need to have them on all 9 legs . 
6 inches . 
we have a king mattress and the front of the mattress hangs over the bottom of the frame so that there is nothing to attach a foot board to . there is something to attach a headboard to if the headboard matches the configuration of the slots in the frame 's headboard brackets . 
i think so . hubby and i are no light weights ( in the 200 's ) and we are both comfortable on ours . however , the whole comfort thing is very subjective . 
not exactly sure how to answer your question ... .but i 'm a pretty heavy guy and i have n't had any issues with the mattress . the only thing i can say is make sure you have a tight box spring so that the memory foam does n't sink into the box . i really enjoy this mattress a lot . 
yes , it 's thick enough to be laid across slats , just make sure you have enough of them . it will feel the best with an even flat surface beneath it , whether you just have it on slats or on a base . the foam is thick enough and it 's sturdy enough 
it should , it 's the same size as a regular twin mattress just a bit thicker . 
in my experiences with the foam mattresses and pillows , they all have a sort of chemical packaging odor . it goes away by itself , you just have to let it air out for a few days , then it is completely gone . i do n't recommend sleeping on it until then , but it really does go away . i do n't know where you are located or what the weather is like , but you could put it outside during the day to help expedite the process . really though , do n't let the smell be the factor in not buying it . we ordered three different foam mattresses from three different places as well as foam pillows and they all had the same odor and in all of them , the smell completely vanished . 
i just used this mattress on my sons wood loft bed 
yes you do , but you can use any kind of box spring with it . i used the one from my regular bed . 
the book provides a cooking guide for meats , fish , vegetables as well as root vegetables , rice & pasta even eggs and fruit . it has a few recipes to get you started and comfortable - easy peasy just like regular traditional cooking i live this appliance 
mine is 11 inch square and to the top of the cover it is 9. fyi i also love it ! 
yes.. it is ... . that 's why i bought it ... . 
yes ! 
i just checked the label and it was made in china . this is one of the best purchases i 've made on amazon because this is a product i use almost daily . better yet - it works as advertised - both here and in the uk . 
yes 
i use my regular tap water , but i guess that would depend on , the quality of water where you live . 
to fill both sides , you actually need more than one box of cake batter . i feel like i used 1 plus another 1 3. but it turned out amazing . 
the bottom is 6 1 2 '' round & 3 3 4 '' deep . the top is 7 '' round at the widest & 3 1 2 '' deep so final cupcake would be around 7 '' wide and a little over 7 '' tall . hope this helps ! 
you do n't need any liners . just use cooking spray . 
i used for pomegranates and it worked great ! nothing like fresh cold pomegranate juice ( i leave them in the fridge before juicing ) . after cutting them in half , i would recommend making some quarter slits in the pomegranate though before juicing depending on the size it will help get more juice out . or cut them into quarters . 
sorry but there is no brand name on it . i will say it is very heavy and seems to be well built for something that came from china . we like it very much . we have it in costa rica for all forms of citrus . i would buy it again . 
i do n't know for sure , but i would assume china . by its quality , def not the usa . 
with the lever up it is 28 '' ( 72cm ) and down it is 16 '' ( 40cm ) . 
yes very strong and good 
mine was all ready adjusted . 
i have tried only with fruits but you can give it a shot ! 
yes , the nutribullet comes with a user guide and a recipe book 
i suspect those who answered you 'd be able to pack little else were thinking a small carry-on bag . the motor is appx 8 inches high and 5 inches in diameter . the largest container is slightly smaller . so , yes , you can pack this and plenty more in a checked bag . 
no ... only 110 
hi there ... . we work with kohl 's on their wholesale loads and currently have many of both types in stock ... we did check to make sure and these are not interchangeable thanks for the question dj partin powerhouse liquidators 
operating voltage is 110 volts . 
yes , it does crush ice 
plastic . with screw on lids . and a cup holder . would recommend the item . more easy to clean than a blender . 
to answer your question , yes , this is made in china . it is stated on the box in which it is packed . 
i do n't know what yerba mate is but i can tell you that the mesh of this item is very fine , much finer than other tea strainers that i have used in the past . this one can be used with rooibos tea which is very fine and tends to get into your cup with other strainers . 
it works in my 2 '' thermos - it does only take the bottom half as infuser widens at the top 
i do n't think so . it 's a very fine mesh . even when i get to the end of my bag of loose tea and its all fine it does n't get thru into my tea . : ) 
hi faith , i am not sure what you mean by your question as i have never made any oil infusions . the mesh is really fine and will prevent almost any sized particle through to the cup except for very fine powders and grains . i looked at some strainers for oil infusers and i think that this should work for you . i am guessing that you will strain your oil infusion through the strainer ? it should be very good for that , but i guess that it might depend on how thick the oil is . wish i could give you a more definitive answer . i hope that this helps . regards , coolahoo 
no , it does not get hot . 
increased hp to 2.2hp , 40 % quieter , low profile carafe to fit under counter , 1-10 speed , no more variable high speed switch to enable highest speed , pulse switch took its place , 4 '' blade diameter instead of 3 '' . 
i 'm pretty sure you can , since the vitamix itself can heat up the contents if you run it for about 5 - 6 minutes . and there 's a video of a vitamix representive himself pouring boiling water into it : https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=ayqbxoke-f4 at about 14:50 . 
yes , the vitamix 7500 ( which is a next gen ) , the pro 300 , and the creations elite are all the same machine , but they come with different cookbooks , and the creations elite comes with a 48 oz carafe instead of the 64 ( see https : secure.vitamix.com certified-reconditioned-next-generation.aspx ? coupon=06-007021 ) . the 750 pro is different - it has added presets . a helpful site : http : joyofblending.com which-vitamix-to-buy 
yes , both are the next generation motor paired with the wider container . both are without the presets that show up on the pro 750. more than you 'd ever care to know about the various models is here : http : joyofblending.com which-vitamix-to-buy http : blenderdude.com articles vitamix-models ( i sifted through these myself when trying to pick which model to buy ) 
yes it is - all current vitamix spin at a high speed that will produce heat due to friction from the blades on the item ( s ) you 're blending - the vitamix professional 300 has the 4 '' blades ( vs. the older 3 '' blades , on say the 5200 ) and would therefore have an even faster speed at the blade tip and therefore produce more frictional heat - i use this same friction heat principle daily to clean my vitamix , i add warm hot water and a drop of soap - after blending on high for 1-2 min , the soapy water foam is too hot to touch ( exceeds 160 f ) . more specifically to answer your specific question , i use this feature to make super creamy soups blended to a perfect top restaurant quality consistency . . . and hot . as another response commented , i have not had the problem of it whipping in too much air , i understand this happens due to making a very small amount of soup ( 1 serving only ) . my experience creating soups in the vitamix professional 300 have been that soups are blended to perfection ( i 've made many types : broccoli , tomato , lobster bisque , etc. , ) . 
preset blend programs . otherwise the same . 
yes checking the serial number on my blade it was manufactured after the recall . 
according the vitamix web site , this unit is 17.5 inches tall with the container in palce . you can veryify on the vitamix web site . 
yes they are , usually able to use over and over . just had my 1st experience of the bag actually tore open , felt brittle 1st time use . not too sure what happened . 
2 smallest bags are roll ups . 
there are special bags for travel that do n't require a vacuum to get the air out . you roll them and it takes the air out . i have some but have not used them yet but they do work cause i tested them . 
i think so . is n't a shop vac more powerful than a regular house vacuum cleaner ? i just use my house vacuum . 
yes it does , i only recommend these ziploc storeage bags because they do work , all others do not keep the air out . i hope this helps , happy hollidays jb 
do n't worry about that , i would not purchase this it has about 5 rips in it already and ive only had it a few months , the first rip started after one month . i hope this helps but i give this futon a -1. i hope this has helped 
about 12 '' off the ground 
hello , that 's a great question . according to the information available on a supplier 's website , the dimensions are as follows : 69 '' l x 30.5 '' w x 29 '' h i hope this is helpful ! 
the same as a regular twin bed . i use those fitted sheets for it and they fit fine . 
this silicone cannonball ice ball mold tray is made in china . 
hello l grooms - it does come with a cover which is silicone and it 's made in china . best wishes - mike . 
deepimpulse , i 'm not sure about the presence of bpa in the ice trays . i recommend you contact the manufacturer to answer your question . 
never got chance to evaluate handle . it leaked so badly the very first time we used it so just tossed it out . was afraid that someone would get burnt . really poorly constructed . shame . it really looked nice . maybe good for decoration but not for use . hope that helps . 
no it does not whistle . however it is so beautiful you wo n't be able to keep your eyes off of it . 
if you look closely the lid has a small protrusion if you put that in first you should n't have any trouble . we have been using using ours for about three weeks and have not had any trouble with the lid . 
i bought this item as a gift and thought it was made in the usa ? the person i gave it to is more than happy with it , it is really beautiful and copper is the way to go for tea pots . this year i found some copper mugs to compliment it . 
i am not sure as i gave these as a gift to my son-in-law . i do n't think it gets as fine as powder but does a good job . my son in-law loves them . 
i put this cover on my child 's mattress , because he has a cheaper mattress , however , he has had trouble laying down for his nap , and staying in bed , so lately , i 'll lay down next to him for a while till he gets sleepy . once or twice i 've fallen asleep , and no it did n't get hot or even warm . it was very comfortable . but i have n't slept on it for an extended period of time . sorry about the lengthy answer . 
my review should have said not overly hot ... .not overly `` horrible '' . auto correct sucks ! 
very ! 
i checked all of the packaging and tags , and did not see anything to indicate that it does . however , i 'm not sure if they are required to label that or not . you may need to contact the company directly to know absolutely . 
i only used cold water for a quick wash and did n't dry , just fluff cycle . worked well . 
yes ! quite nicely ! it is a masticating juicer , which is the type that can juice wheatgrass . 
it has a 1 year manufacturer warranty . 
very simple ... quick and easy 
13 '' from bottom of base to top . 
yes 
it 's a regular size lunch box . you can fit lunch , beverage and snacks 
yes , the material is washable . i have taken a soapy cloth to wipe the inside and outside , no problem as of yet , just wipe down with clear water if soap is used . 
yes . 
yes , but it is a white plastic and flat spatula without a handle and is useful to fold your omelet . 
yes 
box states , `` made in china '' . nothing on product itself . 
i handwash all of it as reccomended by the manufacturer . other reviews i 've read said people had problems with melting in the dishwasher . better safe than sorry , handwashing only takes a short time and will save you the hassle of replacing it should it damaged in the dishwasher . 
i would guess 1oz . they are like a shot . they are a perfect snack for my toddler . 
i have never had this situation , so i do n't know , but i will do some research because it is easy to lose one of the sticks . okay , i just checked the zoku website and they have them for sale . not sure about alternatives . 
i 've read about doing that . not something i would have thought of but i 've heard it 's a good alternative to other liquids . 
any kind of pudding , any kind of yogurt . i also use them without the handles to make fruity round ice juice cubes to put in wine glasses for summer coolers . 
i have n't tried but i 'm wondering when you say gelatin pop , are you not planning on freezing it solid ? i think you 'd have a hard time extracting them with the pop not getting messed up other the stick coming out . the molds are can be a little stiff when cold . never a problem for a solid pop but could be with a gelatin pop . 
yes - the reverse side is gray and has the names of cities like ny and paris written on it . the pattern is the same as the pillow cases shown in the photo . 
no 
mine did not . i bought one from amazon 
duvet and two pillow cases . not shams . the set is nice , but order a size up if you have a thicker mattress . 10 '' or more . 
yes 
this fit a regular queen sized comforter and it had two pillow shams . 
hello sherri the city scape bed set has the following items : - queen size - cover for a comforter 200cm x 200cm two pillowcases 50 x 75cm king size - cover for a comforter 230cm x 200cm two pillowcases 50 x 75cm this item is made from 52 % polyester & 48 % cotton . regards tracy customer services 
i 've used it at 400 degrees f without any problems . the product description says , `` temperature resistant from 446f ( 230c ) to -40f ( -40c ) '' which i think is straight off the packaging . 
not familiar with panasonic vacuums . we have had a kirby , a hoover wind tunnel and most recently an lg ( who no longer makes vacuums ) . we bought then returned the prolux . we tested the dyson animal , the shark rotator professional , the electrolux ( forgot the model ) . then we went to a couple of local vacuum shops . tried the riccar and the meile . we bought the meile and very glad we did . it is worth the money . 
yes it has a full bag indicator . i do n't think it necessarily stops when jammed although this has not happened to me yet . i have not tried to replace the rolller or belt yet but i do n't think it would be too hard . 
yes it does : ) it works on all types of carpet and then with the floor tool it cleans hardwood and tile etc . so yes it will work on any type of flooring . let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs ( seller ) 
11.75 '' . it 's a very nice quality vacuum at this price point . i kept it despite the one drawback ... almost an 8 '' clearance is needed to get under furniture . if you have a vacuum that can get under furniture , keep it as i did . 
i do n't know the exact weight , but it is easy to push on any surface . i have thick carpets and i love how it self - adjusts from the carpet to ceramic tile . i do n't have to use a lot of strength to use it . i highly recommend this vacuum . the best i have ever had . great suction and very simple to put together also . 
yes it does 
no it does not link to fitbit 
yes 
www.balanceliving.co 
no it doesnt . it can store upto 5 profiles internally tho . 
each time you stand on it . it recognizes the person by the weight . unless you have a significant weight loss in a short space of time , it will remember you . you also need to stand on it ( a few seconds ) until it calculates the various functions . 
tenths as well . i am very pleased with this scale . when i first got it , it would only measure weight but i pushed the reset and it started showing everything . very easy : ) 
yes i have used them in the microwave and dishwasher and they still look good as new . i love these dishes 
sorry , i returned these task soon as i got it . the first few dishes i took out of the box were scratched and i figured , if they scratch that easily in the box , how will they look after a couple of months of real use ? 
queen size 
yes . they remove our mattress . 
nope just the mattress 
the number is : m18839.70.7904 best mattress i 've ever owned ! : ) 
sort of both . the top allows it to be soft but it 's also firm . love it . was unsure about ordering on line , but totally worth it 
i do not know if it is dishwasher safe or not . i bought mine to hold 25 # bags of sugar and flour . it is to big to fit in a home dishwasher . 
no , it 's not large enough . it would hold the turkey , but not the brine , if you 're doing a liquid . i 'm using a 4 gallon bucket for 13 lbs . 
11 '' 
i 've never used this in the freezer , but i got curious and poked around a bit and can find no mention of freezer use anywhere for this product . but , a similar question was asked regarding another size ( lustroware b-2896aa smart locks jumbo keeper 2.1-gallon food container , large , white ) and was answered `` unofficially '' as follows : `` i think it would do fine but am not sure how the clamps would fare being opened while super cold . i would let it set out for just a few minutes before unsnapping them . '' 
they have seals . 
67.2 cups 
not at all . although it does draw enough when cycling active that you would not want some other high draw on the same circuit . this thing dry 's my 2000 square foot lower level on auto and has really helped with musty smells ! way better than a conventional dehumidifier . 
turns off . great unit but fills up with water fast ! ! 
we have not noticed an odor . 
on auto mode it takes it between 55 % and 60 % , ideal for many musical instruments . it goes lower if set to high . has a low setting for reduced noise . keeps it around 60 % . we have two running in an exceptionally large room ( combined living dining room with cathedral ceiling ) . taking water out of the air does raise temperature . less need to run as often if room is closed . ours is pretty open . 
i have had the unit for several weeks now . we run it in our daylight live-in basement , which gets very damp in the summer . i was hunting something that does n't make much noise , as loud dehumidifiers are annoying . i was n't even using our old unit before i purchased the edv-400 because i could n't stand to listen to it . i could tell it was getting humid and damp . when we received the edv-4000 i was a bit surprised how small it was and the bucket was small as well . but , i have been very happy with it and do not regret it , at this point . the basement feels very comfortable , it sounds like a fan , and removes a good amount of moisture . as far as 1200 sg ft , i do have less area than that where it is running . i would say if it is completely open it would help . if there are many small rooms with doors , it may be a bit much or you may need two units . 
yes . we just had to screw the feet on . 
about 20 lbs . 
thank you for your interest in our product . unfortunately , we currently only carry the nightstand for this set . sorry for any inconvenience that may have caused . 
i 'm not sure . we have the keurig platinum i believe and it works perfectly . 
it 's open 
it works in any keurig that takes kcups 
yes 
i am sorry but i do not know but it fits my model just fine . 
yes mine did . mine works perfectly . 
i 'm not positive but it does look like it would i have the 65 
yes 
yes it does 
yes 
the wire basket measures 5 3 4 in diameter x 7 3 4 in height . there are little feet on the bottom that add another 1 4 '' to the height . the outside pan is 8 3 4 in height x 6 1 8 `` in diameter . handles extend 2 '' each , from opposite sides . hope this gives you what you wanted to know . s . 
no ! the mesh holes of the basket are way too big for spaghetti . you might be able to use it for rigatoni or other large pasta shapes , but not long , thin noodles . for reference , the holes in the mesh are approximately 1cm wide , and a spaghetti noodle is probably only 2mm wide . 
awesome , love it , 
the part that will touch the stove is about 5 1 2 inches in diameter ( across the middle ) 
it is true . very nice value and functional . we blanch veggies , steam crab legs , etc . in addition to asparagus . it 's a nice additional to your cookware . sharon 
manufactured in china yes . 
no 
there is absolutely no documentation in the box to say . 
mine did n't come with one which i did n't like but youtube has plenty of info on how to use it , the machine itself is pretty easy to put together without a manual . hth ! 
yes , if you pinch it real tight it turns white . i just tried it . what does that mean ? 
hey can hold up to 3.75 ounces . since liquids expand when frozen , it 's best to leave a 1 2 inch or so at the top . i would plan for 3.5 ounces x 6 = 21 ounces . 3.75 ounces = 110.9 ml . 
i put them in a plastic cup upright.they freeze perfect every time ! 
not to my knowledge . just do not overfill them when you place them in the freezer . 
i received the emails and recipes , however , in reading other people 's responses someone gave the website for the company that sells these . the website is : http : www.siliconedesigns.com go to their website and there is an option for `` contact us '' . i 'm sure you can let them know you did n't receive the recipe emails and they would respond . 
i put them in cups or glass mugs i already have in the freezer . 
yes , of course . though i would n't rely on them to toss them in freezer or lunch box . 
when i ordered the ice pops , they automatically emailed the recipes to me . they have great customer service , they emailed me a number of times . 
no bending as the metal is pretty thick . i would n't consider the forks sharp , but they do everything they need to do . have been using this set for a year now and it 's very durable and well made . best set i have ever owned . 
no , but it does have barenthal stamped on it 
4 prongs . i highly recommend them . i would buy another set but i doubt i will need to anytime soon . very well made . 
it is definitely 18 10. it says so on the back of each piece ... .and it has a really nice weight . 
on the box it 's says it designed in france . i looked all over the box and on the flatware itself and it does not say `` made in ... '' anywhere . on the back of the box it talks about how the flatware bares the symbol of barenthal which is a bear logo and the company is located in the east of france . each piece has this symbol . i 'm still not sure if this means it was actually made there , however the flatware has held up great and is a good weight . i do recommend hand washing if you are using it as a special occasion set , hence the dishwasher will dull any set of flatware rather quickly . hope this helps . 
7 '' x 2 & 1 4 '' x 1 '' . hope that helps 
i do n't know where it is made , but it does a very nice job . i use it to sharpen my straight razor and am happy with it . 
yes it could be as long as you keep your stone good and wet and free of collectingdebree . make sure to take your time 
yes ; using it without thoroughly soaking it first will damage the stone and or your knife . 
the dimensions of this pillow are approximately 16 x 12 x 3.5 
yes . i did exactly that . just opened up an end , took out some filling and sewed it back up . warning ... the filling goes everywhere and sticks to everything . but , it worked . 
120vac ; 60cycle ; 1500 watts ; thermally protected . very nice indeed . 
yep . i really like mine ! 
if you have solar panels it runs for free . 
that 's what i would call it . it is not shiny 
yes . 
the lid is one piece . 
i would imagine that you could put them in the dishwasher . however , to preserve the finish , i would just hand-wash them . the finish is rather thin , and scratches easily - so , it would not take long for the dishwasher to remove the finish . they are worth the money ! you will love them . 
12 oz 
i 've used flexible straws from walmart and ikea . they 're striped and colorful . i think the flexible ( bendable ) look cuter than straight straws . 
the lids are made of metal that fit glass mason jars . check the size of the `` mouth '' of your jar to make sure it 's the right size for the lid . 
these particular lids are for standard mouth jars . 
regular 
these are 10.5 inches tall . they are large . i love them . very good quality 
not sure ... they are large ! they do hold almost the whole large bag of generic cereal ... i think they would but my hubby said he does n't think so . 
it easily holds your normal 5 lb bag 
i have never used the rubbermaid modular , but i use these for cereal and the top does stay open 90 % of the time because of a little tab . 
it has .9 hp . i believe it is a little less than 700 watts . please see this review : http : www.popularmechanics.com technology gadgets tests 4332328 
it does crush ice well but works best with a little liquid 
i believe it has to do with the fact that the bad is a professional style as well as the blender container is made of a shatter and crackpot plastic as well as stain resistant . ... motor is quite ... .works like a vitamin blender but it 's a bit bigger ... ..i use vitamin at work ( i 'm a chef ) and i have this at home and it works the same ... .i love it 
yes i can , and do for healthy smoothies , with fruit , almond milk , kale and bananas . 
i believe you can . it 's one piece and it 's plastic . i would do top shelf . 
no scientific evidence about that . but it definitely changes the taste of nappy-texas water . 
it comes with all the filters you need . it says they will last for 6 months . then i believe you will have to order the replacements . 
i found this at their web site : the current line of h2o+ water filtration systems are specifically designed not to remove fluoride . fluoride is a mineral that promotes dental health and has other beneficial qualities when in small quantities , as found in most municipal water systems . however , we realize that some people still want to remove fluoride from their water and are working on additional models to meet this need . go to http : brondell.com water-filter-faq for more details . other than that , it is good for apartments where you can not drill a hole in the counter top to get a reverse osmosis , or i would have gotten a reverse osmosis . 
no . 
it 's approx . 11 1 4 '' l x 6 1 4 '' w x 4 '' h hope that helps 
3.5 - 4.5 '' tall ; 5 '' wide ; 9 '' long 
11 x 6 '' 
yes 
6 x aaa batteries ( not included ) 
aprox 2 oz 
yes , and i love my set . it has been awesome to cook with . 
usa 
no . great cookware set . 
yes ! that 's one of the things i really like about this cookware . the lids are interchangeable on the different size pots and fry pans . 
meyer corporation , they make other widely recognized brands as well like rachel ray , anolon , farberware ect . 
definitely ! 
it did n't fit on my vac-then-steam shark . was disappointed with the purchase as it did n't fit my machine . probably should contact the company and ask them before buying . hope this was somewhat helpful . good luck . 
this seems to be a recurring question , and i 've already answered it a couple of times . it is correctly sized tor the sharp steam and spray mops . i 'm too lazy to go measure it again , but no worry . it 's the same as original , and if you are in need of backup pad , you 'll be happy with it . after hearing from barbara again , i checked with shark via their online chat and was told the 3101 measures 15.5 x 7. i told them they need to make it clearer for customers and potential customers . my own shark is an sk141 , and the 13.5 wide pad fits just fine . it did n't seem to shrink when i washed the original one , but i now see judy has one that 's only 10 inches wide . oh , for the `` olden days '' when there were far fewer choices and no confusion . heavy sigh . 
i would measure the one you got with your mop , i ordered some and they were a little small and kept rolling off the base . 
yes . 
each leg has a hard plastic nylon , button-like slider or bumper on the bottom . the wood of the stool 's leg would not touch the floor . would those bumpers mar a wood floor ? maybe . the pads are not wide , about 1 2 or so . the stools are light and sliding them around to reposition should n't hurt the floor . sliding around while sitting in them might mar the floor , but this is difficult to do with a backless stool . you have to stand and take your weight off the stool to reposition it , much like you will have to do if you use a carpet . for light normal use i do n't think a rug is necessary . another option would be to buy wider bumpers at the hardware store . i have hardwood throughout the house without any rugs . i put nylon bumpers on any furniture ( dining room chairs for example ) that get pushed back and forth under a table and there is no marring of the floor . 
yes , however i did put a clear acrylic stain on the top , this will keep it nicer longer . 
i 'm 115lbs . if they are assembled well they are actually sturdy enough for twice my weight but , that 's a guess . 
yes 
it appears to be a high-grade aluminum -- except for the handle , which is plastic , and the feet , which are hard rubber . it 's a great cane -- the more i use it the more i like it . 
it was a gift for my mom so i do n't have it here but i am guessing it is approx . 2 '' -3 '' in diameter . 
push the button on the handle . 
no we do not . sorry 
if you google trusty cane you will find numerous references to a scam 
no . the directions show the cord wrapped around the base . the lack of a retractable cord would n't deter me from buying this again though . i love it 
i have this iron , and i find that it heats quite rapidly . 
*wattage : 1725 watts *voltage : 110 volts 
it does not have on off button only the temperature choosing role 
i am not certain of that , upon searching their website , i could not find an answer . you may have to give them a call at 800-395-8325 or go to their website and send them an email . 
this iron is 120v . 
china 
plastic body and stainless blades 
yes 
you can cut an apple up to 4 inches across but you need to peel it first . if it 's that big , it 's hard to cut all the way down easily . i had to lean over the counter and put all my weight against it . i was afraid i 'd break the handles off . but once i peeled the apples first and did n't use real big ones , they cut through just fine . i do like the second part . you flip the bottom up and out , slice almost all the way , then return the base and press on down to cut all the way through the apple . it 's amazing and i really like the 16 cuts instead of 8. enjoy yours . i do mine . 
this is not but we do have one made by progressive that gives 2 sizes this is the upc on it : upc : 019578161006 
it should be called the `` hinged pusher '' ; you flip that cover out of the way , push the slicer down over the apple . the apple goes all the way through except for the width of the blades . you flip the cover pusher around and push the apple out of the slicer . do a few apples , it works great ! 
it 's a very stable cart 
2.5 interior height , 12.5 wide & 11.5 deep . i keep steak knives , paring knives loose . 
14.5 '' wide x 13 '' deep x 10 5 8 '' high 
no ! it 's advertised but this particular model does not have the pre-heat feature ! i was not very happy when i discovered this ! ! 
a king-size mattress is a different size from a california king . so , the answer is 'no ' . 
no not at all . it 's actually really comfortable . the wires are pretty thin . 
i 'm not really sure as of yet . we have n't tried to wash it yet . so we are curious about this also 
no . this works on a 110 volt receptacle . 
absolutely . my husband rarely has his side on but mine is on low all night and it 's more than warm enough even for me who is always cold . 
of course it will.warm your feet depending on your sleep position . 
you will need the convertor changing 110 to 220 and set on 1500 or highest wattage . 
i have the floor fan which does tilt . i am sorry i do not know about the tabletop model . 
no , but it is quiet , lightweight and very easy to assemble . 
yes , but incredibly simple . 
yes they do , plus no more neck pain . 
paula , i just bought them . to make up a guest bed for family visiting for christmas , so they are far from needing cleening . no head has hit them yet . but you can put them in washer delicate speed and put in dryer . 
hello kriscpa , this pillow does not have a thread count . the shell is a 50 % cotton 50 % polyester mix . 
hello ramin , yes this pillow is 95 % feather and 5 % down .

yes , and it works very good two thumbs up 
do you mean the tray that sits on top ? yes - http : www.amazon.com ronco-compact-showtime-rotisserie-accessory dp b00006iuv0 ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1422468338 & sr=8-1 & keywords=ronco+accessories you can also get other accessories . in the the amazon search window just type in ronco accessories . 
hi c d ! yes , it comes with a dvd & recipe book ! 
yes it does ... it 's one of the best tools in my kitchen 
i 'm not sure . your best bet is to contact ronco . 
no there are no ties , however , i have not had a problem with the insert shifting . i have two of these covers , one in blue and one in cream and love them . 
no , but i have n't had a problem with it shifting . if i do , i will use safety pins to secure the corners . i 've done that before . i enjoy this set more than any i 've ever used . 
yes , it is currently covering my down comforter now . has button closures . 
sorry for the delay of answering your question . this was made in china . 
yes , but it will not save you from the poor choices you wake up with . 
not sure , it 's well made . you do have to follow the directions carefully . the way it is made , you must pour the hot water 'around ' the coffee grounds , not directly on the coffee . or you will break the filter . once you get the hang of it you will love it . until then , it will make you mad . i think the way it 's designed , you use less coffee .. 
not sure what u mean but i use size 2 filter paper filters . this is good for one cup size . good quality too . 
roughly 23.5 '' w x 14.5 '' d x 25.5 '' h 
this is a really good question , danielle . i had not needed to do any cleaning of my hamper so i went to look at it and investigate a little for you . there is a liner around the entire interior which is different from the outer material and feels like it will keep moisture from wicking through to the outside fabric . i held a cloth saturated with water against the inside material and got no soaking through to the outside at all . i also held the wet cloth against the outside material and got no soaking through to the inside either . in fact , neither the inside nor the outside showed any evidence of having been wetted . so , i think this hamper will be easy to spot clean ( both inside and out ) and to spritz with a cleaning solution and wipe clean . anything more thorough than that i do n't know . i ca n't say positively that the product is `` water proof '' but it definitely resists a thorough wetting . it does fold flat when you remove the top . hope this helps . 
not sure if it 's specifically treated to be mildew resistant , but it 's been fine for us in a bathroom for the last 4 months . 
i ca n't answer in loads but it will hold a weeks worth of mine and my wife 's clothes . 
i got the pretty champagne color , love it 
the outside of this toaster remains quite cool while in use . this is a very good toaster that gets heavy use in my household . 
no , it is a 2-prong . 
1800 watts 
the cord is 32 inches long , not retractable . 
hi . it may but the full width is 5 1 4 and the thickness is 1 1 4. so far it 's been a really good toaster , just make sure ( as with any appliance ) to check your timing settings to make sure you get the results you want . best regards . rick 
it is metal mounted in plastic . the black you see is plastic . 
yes rosie..i 'm happy with the toaster . i have had many toasters over the years and so far , this one seems to do a good job . 
it is a drawer with plenty of room ; i put my grandson 's laptop and mouse in the drawer when he is not visiting . 
no 
no , it is manufactured wood 
29 1 2 inches 
dimensions : 30 inches high x 42 inches wide x 28 inches deep thanks , john c . 
dimensions : 30 inches high x 42 inches wide x 28 inches dee 
yes , the tracks and all related hardware are included , along with nice door knobs . i installed 2 side-by-side for a closet and did n't need to purchase any additional hardware for the installation . 
we do not , all of our doors are clear pine . thank you ! 
good afternoon , we have had some people in the past do this , and had great succses , however , if you were to do this , we would not be able to take any return . they are solid core , so if you chose to cut them , it should work . thanks , aaron 
yes our doors are solid core . thanks aaron 
about 35lbs at most . 
these are one inch thick . thank you . 
it 's one bifold so you 'll need to order two for a full opening . 
the medium seems pretty small to me and it 's very squishy . i would try a lg maybe unless you want a pretty soft one . 
the cover is attached . i just use a pillow case over it . i do n't think there are replacement covers . 
the dimensions are 24.2in x 13.4in x 4.53in which the 4.53in is the thickness height where you lay your head in between . i hope this information helps . 
it 's 3 1 4 '' across by 2 '' tall 
yes . that 's what i bought it for , and it works great . 
i have a mr coffee but it is not programmable . but i am under the impression that this filter fits most 4 cup coffee makers . 
i wash mine by hand , but it may be ok in the top rack of the dsihwasher . i 've never tried it . 
yes , and i am very happy with it . easy to clean and does not create the paper waist of a standard filter . 
they vary in size . small part measures 1 inch and the bigger part is about 1 1 2 inches . for example , the w. the bottom is 1 in and the top measures 1 1 2inch wide . they are all 1 1 2 inches in height . 
no , just fondant . 
not positive but , if they 're not the same they 're almost exact . love , love , love them ! i spray letter with non stick cooking spray first and they come out so easily : - ) 
about 1 1 2 '' 
they are about 2inches big . they are a good size . i ordered ones b4 and they were really small but these were perfect . 
yes it is washable . 
comforter and 2 matching pillow shams . 
yes 
yes it does fit on a queen size bed also very comfortable and very practical also looks great 
hello john , this ia just a print comforter 
hello carolyn , the color is plain solid charcoal gray . thanks ! 
no , it was the comforter , skirt , pillow case and 2 little pillows 
i did not end up looking for pink twin sheets . i found some `` zebra '' twin sheets that look beautiful with it - and my daughter loves - loves them ! ! hope this helps ... 
thanks for your question , after searching our catalog , i did not find this listing in queen size . here 's some search results that you may be interested in : 
works well on hard floors and on all carpets including area rugs . we have a dyson that we use for heavy cleaning and use our bissell for quick clean ups and under beds and cabinets , etc . 
i do n't think it does . it just has a foam filter you can clean . 
hi nancy- the retractable cord on mine measures 15 ft. ( not 20 ft as stated above ) i discovered this vacuum by accident and love it . i have mainly hardwood floors and this is perfect . works great on carpet too . cheers , tommy 
i ordered some from the bissell site , but i would think you find them at an store that carries bissell . 
i have n't weighted it and i 'm sure there are spec 's somewhere that would tell you but i can say that it 's the lightest vacuum i 've ever used . the unit glides along the floor and the handle part is n't awkward to use . if i were to carry the unit in my hand , i 'd say its about 8 pounds . 
thank you for your inquiry , the red ruffle cookie jar is 8 '' h without lid x 11 1 2 '' h with lid x 7 '' w from top x 6 '' w from bottom customer service 
thank you for your inquiry , yes , the red ruffle cookie jar comes with neopene gasket . customer service 
my guess is it would , though i do n't have a dryer to test it . i use one to hold two spray bottles of cleaner and another hold two bottles of alcohol & # 128521 ; 
probably just under an inch 
it 's cold . pretty neat system . my wife uses almost everyday 
you can set it to continually rotate through differen colors , stop on one color or just turn off the light entirely . 
yes , i use grapefruit essence oil and another essence oil to this diffuser . 
hi , the details you were looking for are as follows : item specifications length ( in ) :44 width depth ( in ) :16 height ( in ) :32 go ahead & make a purchase , we strive to offer best product & services . thank you , stores123 . 
yes definetly . it 's very sturdy . 
no . not at all . it s very stable 
32 '' lengths and 44 '' wide . i hope it helps 
i bought two of these mirrors and i love them . the light aspect is very subtle and atmospheric and you can certainly see in the mirror when light but i still have recessed lighting in my ceiling 
hi , thank you for contacting us . yes , you can install the mirror either portrait or landscape . have a great day . regards , howard - lighted image . 
yes there is a built in defogger but we have yet to see it in action so ca n't say how effective it is . 
must be hard wired to a switch . 
hi , the depth of the mirror with the steel base is 1 '' . 
hi , the color temperature of these led 's is 6000k . i hope this helps . 
it must be placed on some type of baking sheet , not directly on the oven shelf . 
i use them for the french macrons 
480 degrees - they recommend it not be used while broiling or in a toaster oven . hope this helps ! 
the inner diameter is 1 13 16 in . i personally find it too big , 1 in diameter is perfect . 
11 5 8 '' x 16 1 2 '' ; you could find this one '' b00cnrgwws '' much better 
approximately 1 '' x 3 4 '' 
no its plastic 
most definitely . you will never have to worry about a mug cracking from freezer temps . 
i would not put hot liquid in it 
no , it does n't sweat and does not leave a mark on tables or countertops when you set it down 
i do n't know if there is supposed to be a soapy liquid inside the mug , ,it is not described with one and i do n't see any in the mugs that i have . i do n't know what good a soapy liquid would be inside the insulated part of the mug because no water gets in there . i have washed them by hand and machine several times and there is no indication of soap anywhere if you have soap in one , i suggest you contact the manufacturer or amazon . 
not to have it in front of me to measure at the moment and thinking of a 12 inch ruler i would say between 9-10 inches high 
it 's 14 '' long by about 3 '' at beater end 
i do n't know , but it is well made . nice quality and performs well . 
no , i have not noticed this at all . i use it regularly , but mostly with cold items so far . thanks . 
14 '' long and 2 1 2 '' diameter 
it 's friendly , works really and very handy . you do n't have to take a bunch of stuff out for a single task ( i.e . : electric mixer , attach the beaters etc . ) 
yes it will work for that , but may take a few minutes . just not instant . 
16 '' -18 '' long with a whip about 6 inch diameter 2.5-3. `` across perfectly fits in any standard coffee cup a great product , use it daily and my wife loves it ! 
i use a bunn 10 cup and had grounds with the paper filters . i 've made full pots for about a week with the reusable filter and have n't had the overflow problem or grounds in my coffee . 
yes 
this filter was designed to fit bunn bx , btx , grx , nhb , nhs , st , hg and ht models . 
metal 
i 'm not sure but i 'm sure it would . i only have the bottom burner model . good luck . 
not sure . it fits the nhbx perfectly . 
i have no idea 
i think it would fit . i have a velocity , a 'm so . however , it is a bit narrower and some grounds got in the pot . 
hi edward , thank you for your question . if by overlay you mean to fold them over we would not recommend this since the fiberglass weave ( that helps distribute the heat ) might be damaged . i am curiou what size is your baking mat that you would like to use our baking mats with ? thank you , sam 
i do n't know what do you mean by `` mats are cured '' . i have used the largest mat in my baking at 400 degrees and it did n't smoke or melt . hope it helps . 
i would think so . they would hold a lot of small mints . it just depends on how you plan to use them . i was having a `` de stress '' party , and had two kinds of chili , plus slaw on the side . i put the slaw in the mini cube . they were perfect for a small serving and it looked nice too . 
they would work if the berries are on the small side . 
the measurement is one square inch 
i arranged them on a platter and then plastic wrapped them good and tight over the whole thing . 
i dont think i would ! ! they are great for cold . 
the funnel down to a smaller square base . t 
yes , but i would cool the pudding down a little before pouring . it is a sturdy plastic . i made panna cotta in it and it was a perfect party serving size for tasting . 
the queen size topper is 58 '' x 78 '' which is 1 inch shorter on all sides than a standard queen mattress to ensure your fitted sheet can still fit over the mattress topper . 
no ! at least my toppers did n't ... charly 
i 'm sure it can , just like any other foam topper . lots of info on how to do it if you google it . most talk about using an electric knife . just check the internet . 
no 
better than a sleeping bag but nowhere near an air mattress . a kid would b ok sleeping on it every now and then ( sleepover ) but not on a regular basis 
8lbs 2inchs thick 
honestly i do n't know what the dimensions of the king size is . i purchased a queen . 
sure ! 
about 32 oz up to the red fill line seen in the photo . the contents only stay pressurized for 2 days . 
i would strongly suggest against it . over pressurizing can lead to the canister exploding . i saw one go once . pretty scary . 
no 
there is n't . however , i expect the glass to last well past the ten year mark with good maintenance and gentle care . i love my siphon . 
yes , go . 
there is a timer on the unit . make sure it has been turned off . if it is n't it will shut off before it reaches 50 ... . i know you said it runs longer and still does n't drop down to 50. make sure you read instructions and check all settings . i had this problem in the beginning ... i had to read the booklet again ... . hope this helps mine works great 
it does make some noise when running but is much quieter than previous units i have owned . i would estimate between 40 and 60 decibels when operating 
we do not recommend putting the mortar and pestle in the dishwasher . 
the swissmar granite mortar and pestle is made in china . 
queen is 90 '' x 92 '' king now says it is 106 '' x 92 '' ( i believe it used to be `` 120 '' x 92 '' ) 
these bamboo are 300tc . because bamboo fibers are short , we are unable to make a higher counts , if we do , sheets will pill a lot ! 
these duvet covers do n't have ties . we carry same exact size insert comforter , to ensure it does n't move inside . 
love these jars ! and no the color does not wash off.. 
yes 
8 oz but i would not order again . when they came in all in the box were broken . unless they change their packing i am sure they will not arrive in good condition . my neighbor ordered them to and they had the same experience two of them were broken in their box . i returned the box of broken glass . 
8 oz aboiy 
yes they are . 
yes 
hi , this item holds 16oz in each jar . thank you , lily 's home customer service 
yes you can use standard lids with glass ... also they are very sturdy i love these i bought two sets 
in the usa ! ! 
i have this griddle , but no , i 've never seen it used on an induction cooktop . all i can say is it works perfectly on my traditional electric stove with coils . grilled cheese comes out perfect every time . pancakes work out equally as well . i can say the same for french toast . i love this griddle because there is no nonstick coating to come off and be in your food . 
11 inch 
no ! this is apparently for gas-fired grill . it takes quite long to heat up . 
the interior is a stainless metal . 
yes , it does . you just need to remove the drip tray , and it fits easily . 
yes . the bottom is stamped with `` made in china '' 
so far so good , i bought one for myself and also for my wife and we could not possibly be any happier with them . i work in the commercial cabling industry and am in warehouses around steel , hammers hammers every tool imaginable , and even though it 's a little scratched on on the bottom , it has maintained it 's seal , no leaks ever . it is definitely designed and built well for the avid coffee drinker such as myself . it is top quality and very rugged . my my wife and are hooked and have thrown out our other travel mugs . i hope this answered your question . 
16 oz fills it and allows it to close the cup without spilling over when you screw the lid on . 
thanks for your question ! according to a supplier 's website the dimension of this loveseat are 40 '' h , 61 '' w , 38 '' d. i hope this helps ! 
no . i just fold it up and store it in the closet of our guest room . 
the mattress is compressed in a compact 1 ' x 1 ' x 4 ' box . it quickly returns to its original shape when it 's removed from the box . 
i doubt it because it is split into thirds . i imagine for a futon it needs to be able to fold in half lengthwise ... 
no , it 's very seamless and comfortable . the only thing i would say to watch out for is if you are moving the mattress around . i was dragging it into place one day and it almost felt like i could 've ripped it where the folds are . the seams are strong there , i just did n't want to test it . 
that would be nearly impossible without ruining it 
do not know 
this is the size of a twin bed mattress when it is unfolded and laying flat . i purchased the 6-inch thick by 78 '' x 38 '' 
no corny disney anything on it . i bought it because it matched my daughter 's room 's theme . i 've never even heard of the movie , but am glad it did n't have any identifying text or faces from it . if you like what you see in the pic , that 's pretty much what you get . it 's decent quality all in all . very soft . 
no it does n't . and it 's not a comforter , it 's just a blanket 
no it does not its a nice warm fleece blanket 
this is one 7.5 '' image for your 8 '' or 1 4 sheet cake . 
yes . no problem . 
either n 8 '' round cake or a 1 4 sheet cake

you will need to contact the seller via message , go into your orders and click on this order then contact seller .

yes 
the pillowcase is double sided , anna on one side , elsa on the other . 
there is one twin fitted sheet with pictures of elsa and anna all over it , there is one flat sheet with the violet pattern that you see in the photo . there is one pillow case - it has elsa on one side and anna on the other . i use this as a game with my granddaughter . each night before she goes to bed she decides which sister she will be and sleeps on that side of the pillow . hope this helps . 
no it is 40 cotton and 60 poly . its more stiff than soft . 
i do believe so lorraine . and btw my little one loves her frozen sheets ! 
yes one side is of anna and elsa . its beautiful the characters are big in the middle from top to bottom , the borders are purple . the other side is white with flowers , if you can see the fitted sheet of the bed its exactly like that with big flowers . 
yes ... ... 
not in a box 
the inventory shown is all currently available . thank you for your inquiry .

sorry but not familiar with this subject . 
the direction say that you can . i have not used it for canning yet . sorry i can not be more helpful . 
i do not know . my neighbor love it however , and it is quite large . you can google it on line ... 
the manual says 12 psi . here is the link to the manual http : www.maxi-matic.com product.php ? productid=206 & cat=80 & page=1 ( page 4 ) 
they are about 3 inches by 1 1 2 inches . i used them at my daughters wedding . they are great . 
no , i use styrofoam . 
no - they are smaller and cuter . 
i would imagine not . they are hard plastic . 
when i make jell-o shots in these i put a small amount in first and let them cool in the stand in the refrigerator then bring them back out and fill . you can also alternate colors that way they seem to not leak if you start with just a small portion . 
honestly , we did n't try to put liquids in them . i think it might because the push part is tight and it holds suction . i think they might leak after a while though , but if it was gon na be holding the liquids for a short period of time , i believe it would work well . 
yes they do 
there is nothing on this rack to hinder placing as wide a plate as you 'd like . the only thing is the height , and yes , the height would fit an 11 inch high plate . any taller is questionable . 
i do n't have exact measurements but it is huge ! i was under the impression it was smaller and i could use for a few plates ... no ! it 's 3-4 ft. tall . still in box because i have nothing to use it for ... 
they seem to be mounted fine 
it plugs into the pad at the top on both sides . each side is independently heated . this is a great pad . i have another pad on top of mine because i do n't like feeling the heating ribs . it works just fine either way . hope you enjoy yours as we have enjoyed ours . 
when the controls are off the are not backlit . the controls are large red orange buttons . when any of the buttons is clicked the choice is lit . the controls are easy to use . i have purchased three of these pads and am very pleased with them . hope you enjoy yours . 
no , it does n't make any noise . it is a very good buy . i have two king sized and am very pleased with the quality , size and price . 
i have not tried the hard candy yet . i have assembled the two halves , piped chocolate into the hole for the stick and then inserted the stick . 
3 to 4 
yes 
i 've purchased two and both were pretty close to picture color .

yes , it is ... .it 's awesome ... i love it my daughter 's room looks great with it ... but i did buy the king size and she has a queen size bed and i do n't think it looks too big , so i think that was a good call . i guess i can speak for if you actually have a king size bed . good luck ... i think it 's a great buy and value . 
you could take it to the cleanewrs it was it on delicate and in cold .

you only get the two with the writing on them , black and gray pillow cases 
two pillow cases are what 's included . no decorative pillows . still a great deal . beautiful set , we love it 
2 pillow cases and a duvet cover . not the duvet . it was a heat purchase 
i am unaware of who that person is , but i ca n't imagine that this is anything more than a seascape collage created on someone 's computer in a few hours . its cool alright . do n't get me wrong . love it . use it everyday . 
yes , and four lovely throws . great quality for the price 
duvet cover , three pillows , two shams , and a bed skirt 
i am not sure but it is very thin fabric great for the price but not very heavy fabric or study . think of like a thin sheet that is what the duvet cover is like . it still looks really great if you have a fluffy cushy blanket to go inside : - ) 
have only washed it once . washed on delicate dried on medium and took out promptly from dryer . it looks great . i think it will hold up nicely 
no 
a little larger then standard king ... i purchased a king down comforter to stuff my duvet cover with and the cover is larger then the comforter ... .i believe the exact dimentions are on the web site for the cover and pillows ... .it would easly fit a larger then king bed ... 
the material is much thinner and starchier . in the end , i returned mine and decided to spend more money on one from pottery barn . but for the price , it is a decent product . 
yes 
sorry , but i ca n't answer this one . 
i believe the grinder ( and other attachments ) made for the bosch compact mixer will fit . unfortunately this model seems to have been discontinued by bosch , but there are third party manufacturers that make a grinder that will work with an additional adaptor . also , there may be some available on ebay ; i just purchased one on there for my styline and am waiting for it to come in . ca n't wait to try it out ! 
not sure of actual dimensions , it was a gift for my mom . i do know it is very compact and fits nicely on her limited spaced counter . she is bet pleased ! 
hi , i 've used the bosch styline mixer a couple of times and still have not used the clear lid when making pizza dough , cookies and cakes . you can operate the mixer with the lid on or off . yes , ingredients can fly out , but i 've never had that problem ... yet : ) 
it holds 12 ounces . i just took a measuring cup and kept filling to get the answer . 12 ounces no problem tried to add a little more and it was at the top of the filling spout . hope this helps . 
i believe it comes with a 1-yr manufacturer 's warranty . my steam adjustment lever and i had to send to one of rowenta 's authorized service centers , they were unable to fix so rowenta replaced with a completely new iron . the process took about 3-4 weeks of not having an iron , but in the end they did make it right . 
i am sorry i ca n't offer you a comparison . i went for the 9280 because i iron a large variety of fabrics , and i sew as well . i have owned the iron for less than a month , but i have ironed linen , polyester chiffon , 100 % cotton ( both knit and woven ) , girl scout patches , and cotton poly blends . no leaking , no scorching . this is a big , heavy iron that ejects lots of steam , so be prepared . it glides smoothly and effortlessly . i have experienced no scorching or yucky marks transferring to the soleplate after almost a month of daily use . 
yes . more steam release to the fabric to eithe add a crease or remove a wrinkle . much improvement over the dw6080 . you wo n't be disappointed . 
extra large water tank , is 12.7 ounce water tank . same tank as the rowenta dw8080 pro master steam iron . 
hello - i love this iron . it is new for me . i do n't feel it is too heavy . i often hold it up to steam clothing vertically after i finish using the board . 
it 's ok could be better but still like the iron 
yah it will shut off of left unattended for long periods . not sure of the exact cutoff time period 
it does not appear to have a temperature setting on it but it has settings for different style fabrics which operate at different temperatures . you are also in control of how much steam comes out . 
i have not had that problem with this iron , but i did with a previous rowenta ( different model ) . i iron 5 to 6 hours a week and have not really had any major complaint with any rowenta i have had . sounds like a problem with yours . hope this helps .

what size should i order for a queen size bed and the curtains # . are the curtains long to the floor or short 
dear friend , we have the matching curtains , please enter ''b00eb1vknk '' on amazon search bar , and choose the best size you need : ) ) 
4.5ft bed is full size , dear friend , and it 's a duvet cover , not a duvet : ) ) 
hi , thanks for your question . you may be interested in the following king size bedding by diaidi : 
the lacquer finish protects the copper so i would n't want to remove it . 
these mugs are made of pure copper with no inner lining . this is really good because most mugs are lined with nickel which gets eroded and mixed with the drink which results in nickel consumption ... .that can be bad for health ... so pure copper with no lining is the best ! 
yes 
this are nickel lined . 
our mugs are not embossed . 
no . it is just a plastic pitcher with a removable strainer . you fill it partially with hot water , let it brew , then add cold water ice to quickly cool it down quickly . 
there is no number , however it says it is bpa free 
no . the water must be boiled separately in a pot on the stove or in an electric or regular kettle . 
absolutely ! just fill the inner net tube ( do n't know name ) with 10 tea bags whatever flavor and pour the hot water to correct line , let steep , add cubes , done 
erik , per the manual and my experience using the oven , the maximum temperature for baking is 450 degrees and can be adjusted downward in 25 degree increments . lowest temperature that i have seen is 175 degrees on the keep warm setting . the broil function has a fixed temperature of 500 degrees . it is the default temperature setting for broil and can not be adjusted within that function . i hope this helps . 
yes , it does have a nonstick interior . there 's a lot of misinformation here . this is right in the product description on the product page : `` the easy-clean nonstick interior is so roomy ... '' 
no , it does n't make the room hot . i cook my pizza in it now . it does a great job . a very good item ... wish i had gotten it a lot sooner ! 
it has neither a zipper or buttons . the closure is by tying and it comes out pretty functional , and looks good when tied 
i do not know thread count , but it is very durable , nice looking and this color blends very well with any natural colors . 
yes , we have matching sham and pillow cases . unfortunately we are currently out of stock and we expect our next shipment in about a month . 
queen fits , but the duvet cover is maybe 3 inches longer than it is wide so there is left-over space at the bottom . 
just the cover 
this duvet covet is tie closure instead of zip closure . most of our customers find it to be pretty easy to use . 
the only difference is the color . the white ones with the colored trim are the standard ones the company typically carries . i believe the black ones with the colored trim were custom done for a different company , as they are not offered by the manufacturer or in any local retail location . 
this crock-pot does n't cook , it just warms . the oatmeal would already need to be cooked . 
110 
it 's not stainless steel , but a sturdy aluminum . 
this unit uses approximately 0.42 amps . 
unfortunately i do n't know , but i can say it did not appear to be a power burden on any outlet we have used thus far . 
it does not . i just unplug it . not a big deal for where it sits . 
maybe about a foot . not long at all . 
im not sure possibly mdf but they are solid and god quality 
the dimensions are chair : 24 '' d x 17.75 '' w x 39.5 '' h seat:19 inches high x 17.70 inches wide x 17 inches deep 
these chairs would be just perfect for 30 1 4 '' high table 
these chairs can support up to 250 pounds 
the color in the picture is pretty representative to how it looks in real life . the color is off-white . 
they are not but the fabric is very durable . easily gaurded . 
this chair is 18 '' wide . 
minus the frame , the actual mirror glass is approximately 9 1 2 '' wide . 
well constructed no spray on flocking small padded area on top for rings and pins . 
i suppose you could hang the ties on the spot for the necklaces . but i do n't think sunglasses would fit anywhere . it 's really designed for different types of jewerly . 
on the regular hook , probably 28 '' . i have a lariat i hand on the right side and it 's 48 '' . it lays in front of my bracelets . 
i believe so . the door appears to have a magnetic latch . 
i used this on my oreck xl gold and it worked perfectly . as i remember it is an oem part . 
mine is an xl and the replacement works great . not sure about his model , but i 'd say it 's worth a try . i think it should work . 
all `` xl '' s do not use the same size or type of brush roll , because `` xl '' by itself is not any specific model . `` xl '' is merely an oreck trademark used with dozens of different upright model series . fit goes by your specific xl model number , not just the fact that you have an `` xl '' . xl model numbers start with `` u '' or `` xl '' , but are followed by 4 numbers , and often an alphabetical suffix after those numbers . those 4 numbers ( and sometimes the suffix ) , determine whether or not this xl brush roll will fit your xl model . for example : xl21 , xl2000hh , and xl2000rb are 3 different `` xl '' models , but , each has its own different size or type of brush roll , that wo n't work with the other two . 
i had n't thought about it , but now that you mention it , i 'm pretty sure that the answer would be yes . what a great idea . i 'm ca n't see any reason that that would n't work . 
seems to be a high grade heat resistant silicon . 
never used it to make foam but says its good for temps up to 120. makes great whipped cream though : ) 
yes it can . it can even hold 3. when it gets to the point where it wo n't any more gas , it will come out the safety hole in the charger cap . 
per the instruction manual that came with it , `` it is not recommended to wash in the dishwasher as this may damage the bottle and head . '' i just fill it with warm water and dishwashing soap , open the valve a bit , to clean the valve , then rinse with warm water . 
if you are using heavy whipped cream , who really cares ? 
yes if you are making whipped cream , add one charge and shake it up . whipping siphins can be used for much more . bread to hollandaise mousse and that 's just using nitrous . 
no 
yes . you can use as little as you want and just adjust the amount of sugar you add to the liquid accordingly . 
if it fits yea ... but in order to whip cream you 'll need nitrous because of the chemistry . co2 charge ( food grade ) to make carbonated liquids . 
made in china . 
i have this set off pans and a stand alone induction cook top separate from my electric cook top . these pans are very nice but copper is not magnetic nor is the stainless steal layer magnetic grade therefore they will not work on an induction stove . as someone else noted test your pans with a magnet . if it does not stick to the pan you will not be able to induce the magnetic field necessary to heat the pan . 
it 's really copper . 
they will handle the oven just fine . i often start a dish on the stove top and then transfer to the oven to finish . dishwasher is n't recommended if you want to keep them pretty but it should n't hurt the performance of the pans . 
you can squeeze 9 in there if you pack them on their sides . i just tried it . that is without ice . of course the bag will keep them cold for a while . 
product dimensions : 8.5 x 5 x 10 inches 
no , this one still only has the velcro . 
the blades are metal it also comes with a replacement 
do n't waste your money this is a pice of junk . the machine does not shave ice . it has a common razor blade in the top and if you use one ice cube or even small ice chip it wont cut nothing . it just a colorful piece of junk 
in the top it holds about 2-3 cups of ice cubes . it shaves down pretty quick . 
this is a piece of junk , do n't wasteal your money ... .it wo n't shave ice at all 
4ft 
yes , it is not battery powered . it must be plugged into a wall outlet in order to work . 
hi mario , thanks for your interest . it really depends on if you are shipping standard , ground , express and where the shipment is going . we normally try to ship within a day . i hope this answers your concerns . thanks for you interest . 
it comes in folded in half . it arrived in a box that was about 37 '' x 37 '' . hope this helps . 
hi , yes , we do . 
hi ! the product came with a cardboard attached to the back , so it can stand up . i think with a very good , sticky tape or hot glue gun , it can be attached to a wall . another alternative will be to make small holes through the cardboard and use fishing lines . hope i answered your question ! 
we do not unfortunately , we currently only offer shipping to the usa . 
typically 3-6 days . 
i doubt it , however the recipe book that comes with it has vanilla souffle ; chicken tenders ( breadcrumb ) and croquettes . the point is these dishes that need flour required premix of oil with the coating prior to air fry . i tried the croquettes and it was kind of dry . the only way is to dip the croquette in oil or brush it heavily with oil to make it crispy . anything with flour coating seems a challenge here . i am very happy with fried chickens ( no coating ) as the skins are always crispy ! 
i have never seen the older model , but the accessories that go inside are the same for both models available in the us , so i would guess they are about the same size . i believe the bigger model is sold in europe , but is not available here yet . i have a family of 4 and the capacity in this air fryer fits our needs just fine . we use ours every day ( ca n't imagine a bigger one ) . 
i was wondering the same thing so i searched the reviews . i discovered this in d. greenbaum `` doctordave '' 's review on march 19 , 2014 : `` crisping up some tofu was amazing . '' that pretty much sold me ! 
sim possivel . a minha esta no brasil . mas ela no tem conversao para celsius . 
120 
120v 60hz 1425w . i absolutely love this machine . we 've used it almost every day since getting it . 
it 's a coated pan so unless you scratch it deeply and keep it wet i ca n't see how it will . it is a very sturdy and heavy pan . hope this helps . 
no , the only recipe is ( delectovals mini cakes ) , if this is the same as ( twinkie ) i do n't know 
twinkling good vanilla snack cakes - it is on the king arthur flour web site . 
there are many different products you can buy to fill pastry , it depends on your comfort level and what you are filling . wilton and norpro have some good options that are kits with different tips . i have been decorating for many years now and i have a long stainless steel tip that i use with a pastry bag . you can purchase many of these items on amazon . if you choose the tip and pastry bag option , look for a 'bismarck ' tip . the length allows you to get the tip further inside the pastry lengthwise for filling . 
yes it can ship right away if ordered today 
no 
wilton lists the depth at 1 1 2 '' but in my opinion , it 's closer to 1 1 4 '' . 
if the oven is large enough for the pan to clear on all sides and close properly it should be fine . i am not familiar with that brand of oven so i do not have an idea of what the internal dimensions are . if a cookie sheet fits this should work . 
on the handle of the lid there is a button to push , that releases the top so you can flip it open . after you do that , turn the infuser counter clock-wise to loosen it . then grab the infuser 's handle and pull it through the top . reverse to place it back in . 
absolutely ! ! ! ! i 've done both frozen and fresh and they work great . i 've used this infuser now for over a month and we love it ! ! ! ! with the size of the infuser the fruit lasts for a good week . one little tip : be sure to shake it each time before you pour to get the maximum flavor . you 're gon na love it ! ! ! ! 
11 1 2 inches at the tallest point - with the lid on and closed ; fits in my fridge door 
it is heavy plastic so i suppose you could but infusion works best in cold water . 
the core did not have anything to put inside other than whatever fruit you want to add . i sometimes freeze the fruit in the core and once it freezes put it in the pitcher . 
60 x 75 
the product information says 46 lbs . my husband and i were able to get it in our rv easily . the compressed packaging worked nicely . we spent our first nights on it recently , very comfortable . 
3 year limited warranty , in the short time we have had it , we find it very comfortable , a little bit firm . we are very happy with it . 
david - the mattress does not have cool gel in it as far as i know . however , my wife and i sleep cool on it . 
it says in the amazon specs for this product 60 '' x 74 '' x 9 '' 
i do n't know what `` short '' refers to but the dreamfoam bedding is the standard queen size ( 60 '' 79.5 '' ) 
it only took about an hour to fully expand 
we put ours on the bed in the morning and slept on it that night . it 's in our camper so once we slept on it the following weekend , we could tell it had expanded more but it was definitely sleepable the same night . 
this `` thing '' is an adapter that goes onto any standard `` paint ball '' co2 canister bottle so that the bottle can be used in place of the co2 cylinder that came with the sodastream . the cylinder that comes with the sodastream has a non-standard head that screws into the sodastream . using this adapter allows use of a standard paint ball cylinder bottle at a fraction of the cost . standard paint ball bottles can be refilled at most sporting goods stores for $ 5.00 give or take a dollar . the sodastream bottles must be sent back to sodastream to be refilled or exchanged at a cost of $ 25 - $ 50 depending on the size of the bottle . this adapter goes on top of the paint ball cylinder and allows it to screw into the sodastream machine . works great ! ! ! 
the penguin model uses the 12oz tanks . 
i take my tanks to my local propane gas vendor and their co2 gets delivered as `` food grade '' or `` beverage grade '' . i 'd check around ! 
i do n't know what a fizz chip is as my unit does not have one , but i can try to think this out and hope i do n't coming across wrongly . if your vehicle had a 12 gallon fuel tank and you replaced it with a 20 gallon one and this tank came with an adaptor , would your vehicle still run and all your radio and electronics in the vehicle still work ? i would think so . side note : what i ended up doing was going to roberts oxygen and purchased their large syphon co2 bottle , i think it was a 25lb bottle , for $ 220 filled with co2 . i then purchased a refill tube , 24oz paint ball bottle and a scale from amazon . i now refill the paint ball co2 canister in my garage . when i run out of co2 in my 25lb tank , i can exchange it for $ 30 with another tank filled with co2 . so , my initial total cost was $ 400 . but now , the refills are not $ 15 per 16oz bottle , but $ 1.20 per 16oz . breakeven for me is 26ea 16oz bottles , about one year . after that , my gassed water will cost me $ 30 a year . my breakeven point is actually sooner as i do n't have to drive around , spend money on gasoline and my time to exchange the bottles . hope that helps . 
it appears well-made but we have lots of trouble adjusting it ... have lost 2 canisters of co 2 trying to get it right . any advice ? 
pd , if you have adjusted the center pin per the instructions ( you can also watch the youtube video for help http : youtu.be uqv0ns2vn_k ) and you are still having a problem please feel free to contact us at 800-492-8221 and we can walk you through the process . sodamod 
i am confused . the reason for buying the adapter is so that you can use paintball co2 canisters which are way cheaper to fill . your soda stream canister already fits in your soda stream machine . 
the largest tank that genesis can support is the 12oz tank . 
i think it is reverse thread . 
yes it is perfect for things like that- 
absolutely . the whisk attachment is amazing with the small stuff like that . 
no , i have used it for whipping cream , mashed potatoes , guacamole and drinks with ice . ! 
as long as there is sufficient liquid . i blend mostly frozen fruits with it . 
very easy . there are n't any nooks or crannies where things can get lodged and missed . probably the easiest way is to immerse it in some soapy water , and turn it on for a few seconds , then run it under clean water under the tap . 
not at all . very easy to use and comfortable to work with . it 's so quick you do n't have to hold it for very long at all ! 
the outer casing and blades are all stainless . the upper part is stainless except for the grip . it is very heavy duty . 
i emailed the parent company and they gave me the customer service phone # in canada to call . i did and i have a replacement cup on the way ! customer service line at 1-866-832-4843 , from monday to friday between 8:30am and 5:30pm eastern time 
no 
it 's plug-in . 
http : youtu.be ll4qkt4jz00 this will help to explain some differences on video , also dc40it is easy to empty out the vacuum 's canister . the roller ball makes this machine easy to maneuver while limiting what the vacuum can go under like couches and beds . the dc40 lets you turn off the brush bar when you are vacuuming hardwood floors . there are complaints that the dc40 has a high pitched whine , though it is quieter than competing vacuums . cons the dc40 's cord length is only 25 feet . the dc41 's cord goes an extra ten feet . you may end up unplugging and plugging back in the dc40 as you clean a room . its bin only holds 0.42 gallons of dirt and debris . if you are cleaning a dirty room , you may have to empty it more than once . the bin does n't attach as securely as prior dyson vacuum versions like the dc25 . the machine has such powerful suction that it sometimes stalls on shag rugs . the dc41the dc41 is designed for people who own animals . it does a great job picking up cat and dog hair . you have to clean out the suction chamber regularly to maintain its strong suction . it is also supposed to be able to handle more types of flooring than the dc40 . this vacuum also has a wider cleaner head , so you 'll need fewer passes to clean the floor . the dc41 has a larger bin at just over half a gallon . this vacuum also has about 10 % more suction power . this vacuum has auto-leveling wheels to help it get all carpet or tile equally well . the dc41 does n't need to be adjusted when you transition from carpet to tile or hardwood floors . cons the power cord is not retractable like earlier dyson versions . and while this is the latest edition of the vacuum , it lacks the headlight earlier versions often had . the vacuum wand does n't have much reach . if you want to use the vacuum wand , you have to attach a crevice tool to the hose which adds to the time it takes to vacuum corners and crevices . and then , because the crevice tool is seven inches wide , it does n't fit into the small nooks and crannies that need to be vacuumed out the most . 
it switches from floor to rug with just the touch of a button . you 'll love it . 
long skinny tool for along woodwork , brush attachment , small flat suction tool 
yes , outstanding on carpet 
my wife and i estimate the chord is 30ft ( 10 paces ) and the coil and wand extended is 12ft 
no 
i think the 41 is a bigger machine physically than the 50. i do n't know if there is a difference in suction though . i can tell you that my dc41 has a lot more suction than my previous old dc7 and i think it does a great job . 
no 
just the mini turbine head and a hose extension in the handle for it . 
7.8kg 17lb 
the weight is 8.6 oz each . 
yes 
i gave it as a gift at christmas time , but i believed it was made in china . the inside was stainless steel and the outside was molded plastic . it 's a very nice mug . 
i would say yes , we always wash them in the dishwasher . 
4.75 '' on the outside . from bottom to top inside is 4.25 '' and you can fill it up to about 4 '' with room for the lid . 
10 oz . 
three years from the date of purchase , the product is warranted to be free from defects in material and workmanship . 
you may need an adapter for european electricty . have two - really great product . 
the cord is long . mine ( t f ) is about 12 ft from the pad to the control , and 7 ft from the control to the wall plug . it is designed to go under the bed , and the control can rest on a side table . 
no 
the woven cord on the included probe is 45 '' long . the cord on the optional `` thin '' probe is 50 '' . 
you can close the oven door on the cable with no problem . you ca n't leave the monitor in the oven . btw , the monitor has a magnet on the back so i put it on my refrigerator while i have the probe in the oven . you could also stick on the side of the oven . 
yes 
it takes two aaa batteries . the worst part of changing them is that the magnet that will hold the thermometer to the grill is right next to the phillips screw that fastens the battery door- a magnetized screwdriver can easily push away ; a non-magnetized driver will easily be drawn onto the magnet . no big deal , just something to be aware of ! 
i used it on a london broil in the oven and the barbeque and got excellent results . as specefied in the directions ; you need to use a little care to route the cable away from open flames . 
should work fine . 
no 
it comes in a very nice zipper case , with probe and instruction manual . 
i would n't put them in the dishwasher , but yeah , they are washable . the cable is covered in stainless steel braid , and the probe looks to be stainless steel as well . no worries . 
the bottom square is 12 '' by 12 '' all around , 2-10x10 '' , 2-8x8 '' , 1-top 6x6 '' and that hold the squares the tubes are 4 inch , a height of 15 or 16 inches from bottom to top 
no 
standard cup cakes 30..you maybe able to fit a few more in . i did n't want to spend a lot on a stand so i raised it by sitting it on top of my round corner wear and covered the corner wear with cheveron paper to match my theme then i put the extra cupcakes in front on the actual table.forgot to take pics but it came out nice.. oh and i put a 6 inch cake on top . 
yes it can . very easily comes apart & goes back together . very sturdy . 
no they do n't , once they 're in the slot that 's it . 
yes , i had cupcakes for on the tier about 40-50. but , i feel that it will hold a 8 '' cake as long as it has good support that the cake is put on . 
yes 
i never measured the thickness , but is just right for me to use @ parties with cup cakes or tiny sandwiches it looks grear on my table ! 'll give it a 10 ' 
i would n't recommend it . 
its a light and thin cotton material so not very durable but soft comfortable . 
dimensions : 15-6 8 '' high x 11-6 8 '' wide x 3 4 '' deep . the background color of the picture is a bright orange in the daylight . it looks much nicer when it is dark out . it took me a while to find the on off switch . if you are holding the picture with it facing you , the switch is on the right-hand side towards the bottom of the print . it is somewhat cheap looking but as i said before it looks much better at night . 
all different sizes but i chose the 11x 16 ones . the depth is about the same as a canvas frame .gave them as christmas gifts and they love them . 
its smaller than i expected but still like 
we have about 20 bosc pears we are waiting to ripen completely off the tree . jury is still out , but it might work if you cut the stem off , and maybe adjust the knife . 
the box says `` made in taiwan '' by be lih do co. , ltd 
no . you can only adjust it to slice or to not slice at all . 
yes it slices it into a real pretty spiral that can break off into perfect pieces . 
i would n't feel comfortable sleeping in it for any long duration . it was nice for a few nights , but not the support i personally look for in a permanent bed . 
the directions said 300 pounds . i was using it for a child . it seemed very sturdy to me . 
yes they do 
about 2.5 ' by 4 ' 
you 'd be cutting it very close , as the bed is 75 inches long , so he 'd only have 2 inches to spare . i added a 3inch memory foam and placed it below the mattress . 
i fold the frame and slip the folded mattress inside the folded frame and then into the cover . you ca n't fold the frame and mattress together . 
no . 
it would need to be close to a window for ventilation . its suggested to be no more then 4 feet away from the vent source . 
yes , if you are referring to the window installation kit , it does come with it . `` unit must be vented to the outside ( use included window installation kit and follow detailed installation instructions in the owner manual . ) '' 
its what you 'd expect from a regular ac unit . i do n't even notice it . 
not long enough 
yes 
yes it is but i ca n't tell u the diameter because it 's put away for the winter . you can find several videos on the internet about this unit . 
it runs like a window ac with a compressor and freon 
seat is 13 1 2 across ( wide ) , lowest sitting height is 25 1 2 and the highest is 32 1 2. sits solid even at highest . the lower part - foot rest ( or circled part ) is 16 1 2 across ( wide ) . the legs at the bottom are 20 1 2. but i 'm sure you can angle the chair legs to fit a tighter fit . hope this helps . 
yes , it can be stained all it needs is to be sanded and then stained the color of your choice ! hope this helps ! 
10 inches from the floor . 
they are welded . they are very sturdy . we are well-pleased with our purchase of 6 . 
they are n't bad . we use them daily 
the wooden seat is 13 1 4 inches .

i no longer have these , but i remember them well . i would say that the seats in the 2nd row need to be 4 feet away for optimal space , however ... since the head part does not recline as low as the foot part on the units behind , you could really get away with 2 feet space between units . 
here are all of the dimensions : seat size : 19 '' w x 21 '' d , back size : 22 '' w x 28 '' h , seat height : 18 '' h , arm height from floor : 25 '' h , arm height from seat : 7 '' h , overall width : 63 '' w , overall depth : 38 - 68 '' d , overall height : 43.5 '' h . please let us know if you need any other information . 
no i do n't think so ... the base is one unit 
yes , the seats are great 
the entire size of the back ... .approx 30 '' to 3 feet 
there is only a 2 seat and 3 seat . the 3 seat item number is bt-70259-3-bk-gg 
yes they do 
i do n't know actual dimensions . it was packaged and delivered on a pallet that would not fit through our doorway . we unpacked the box and chairs our garage . my husband and oldest son brought the two pieces in and carried them into our basement where we assembled them without any issues . 
no it does not include a bed frame , if you want that it 's extra please call us at 888-694-4088 to buy one . 
yes , this model does have a removable drip tray . it also has specific settings to use for moist or dry foods , so that helps in the prevention of spills . hope this helps ! 
yes it works with jar sealer 
perfect . sealed packages do n't leak . 
it will depend on the brand of bag you use . foodsaver brand ... yes you can . 
since it vacuums out all liquid , you probably will need to pre-freeze . when i need to do sauces , or meats , i make a foodsaver bag , then freeze my food in that , and vacuum and seal it the next day . hope this helps ! btw , we use it more than i could have imagined . it is a nifty device ! my husband loves it . 
to the best of my nowlage you put what ever in the bag and seal it you have to hold the bag there it aslo have a hose which you can buy canister for it and it also has a jar lid one to seal jars if you want it but the canisters and jar sealer are sold separate . i use the canister so far to save my oat meal it works realy good love it . best of luck i hope this answers your question 
yes it is 
i would use the foodsaver bags myself . they are pretty heavy duty and are built for the machine . i would imagine other types of plastic bags would work , they would have to be thicker though . 
have no idea . 
what is the question ? 
not by metrokane - by ipow . 
no 
unfortunately the calendar for 2014 was n't signed . i tried getting his signed 2015 calender when it first came out on districtline.com joeygraceffa , but they were all sold out . your best bet if you want a signed 2015 calender would be to go on districtline.com joeygraceffa . they 're a little more expensive , but there should be some in stock . also more joey merch there . not to make anyone stray away from amazon.com though : 
joey said on the vlog about this that it will probably ship international . but not 100 % sure 
thank you for posting your question . unfortunately this item can not be shipped to the uk . as of today there is one seller who is selling this item . please note that while some sellers ship internationally , others do not . an easy way to check if the item can be shipped to your location would be to add it to your cart and then click the `` proceed to checkout '' button . an error message will appear if it is not able to be delivered to your destination . if you are able to proceed through the order process you will be shown shipping methods speed prices to chose from . hope this helps 
joeys working on internashiol shipping 
i 'm on vacation so i ca n't measure it but it 's about the size of a carry on suitcase . very compact . hope this helps . i will measure it when i get home sunday and get back to you . 
about 40 
15-30 seconds . just opening the plug on the end will deflate quickly but you can also turn the air pump on and set it to deflate and the motor will suck air out of the mattress . it deflates quickly enough by just opening the valve that i 've never used the pump except to see how it worked . 
big enough to make 2 extra long twin beds into one california king 
not sure of exact length but it fits comfortably around two twin mattresses to make a king sized mattress . 
i would think so since it is adjustable . you can sinch it up as snug as you want . 
the straps are much longer than needed . i put two twin xl ( not adjustable ) together and used about half the strap . 
we only used it for two twin mattresses and it worked great . since two straps could be hooked together , i would imagine that you could use the two straps to get enough length to go around two mattresses of differing sizes . 
the beds are even . with a good quality mattress pad , you would n't know that they are not one . 
i have one in my car trunk also in my 2 suvs . yes they hold grocery bags and keep them from tipping over ! love ours ! ! 
yes , it does . 
i bought 2 sets of these . each `` leaf '' measures 7 1 2 '' x 6 3 4 '' . it should have been listed as cm . instead of in . 
yes , need to have some water to stick to smooth surface 
no . thick plastic . 
yes . clear and colorless 
i gave them as a gift so i 'm not certain but they looked like a standard restaurant size . 
the glasses are made of tritan which is a product of eastman chemical company . it is listed as bpa free and i recommend searching eastman tritan to find their product info page for further details . 
it is recommended that they not be placed in the dishwasher . however , i have accidently put them in once or twice without a problem . i do n't know how they would fare with daily washing . 
the box says hand wash , so that is what i have done . sorry , i do not know if they are top rack ok in dishwasher 
i think they 're 8oz 
includes : vertuoline sampler 8 coffee , 4 espresso 
you can customize the machine to make up to a 17 oz . cup of coffee . it 's easy to do . each type of coffee pod has a barcode , so you need to customize once for each blend . after you pop the pod in you just hold down the `` start '' button until you get the amount of coffee you want , then you release the button . the machine will then remember what size cup of coffee you want for that particular blend . ( you are also able to de-program the machine to go back to the original setting if you prefer . ) 
the coffee i get is nice and hot 
no i do n't think ! ! 
first and foremost , you should n't have to microwave coffee to get it hot , it hurts the flavor secondly , it would be a pain to do it every time . it might be hot enough for you , but it was n't for me ! 
i myself have no problem with the coffee temperature . i always warm up the coffee cup with hot water first , dump out the hot water , then make the coffee . easy breezy . 
this is a foam mattress topper . if you have a thin mattress or springs stick up then this is a good one for you . i priced others like this at $ 150 . even at walmart ! i am glad i found this because it served the purpose well . 
the foam is dense . i put it under a mattress cover to protect it from liquids and myself from the used mattress . i sleep comfortable with it . it is much better than the egg carton type . 
after you allow it to sit for 48 hours to `` poof out '' it gets very stiff . yes , i guess you could try and roll it up , but i would recommend using something strong to tye it down with , as it will take up a lot of room . good luck ! 
this is just the form . and it 's not like the smudgy foam it 's more of the stiffer side . 
not sure of the density but it is wonderfyl 
yes , will take some work . cut before it expands with exacto knife 
china 
i do put mine in the dishwasher 
i believe some reviewers use it to rinse their mouths after brushing . i use it to store toothbrush 's 
yes . love these cups . perfect for the kids . 
no just one when i bought it . it is a great cup . 
no you can not . most high-powered , high-torque machines will be that way . the drive line is all metal for strength and durability , and the bearings are sealed . it also eliminates the leaks , and misalignment issues caused by improperly assembled removable blades . the down-side is it can be a bit tricky to clean . 
my wife has used it to easily make salsa , soup , green smoothies , and nut butter . she has n't tried to make dough with it yet . 
apple seeds are reported to contain cyanide , so best to remove before putting in blender . 
the bottom portion of the side walls make a 45-degree slope down to the floor of the pitcher , which is flat under the blades . 
yes . i just called oster a couple days ago to ask about replacing my jar under warranty because it was leaking . no questions asked , new jar is being shipped to me at no charge . and they told me to discard my current jar . 
pretty standard . seat is curved - 17 '' in middle to 19 '' on sides . 
they are if you 're wearing jeans or thick pant , but any longer than a typical dinner and you might want to invest in some chair pads ( which i did - i only use them when i know we 're going to be sitting for longer than an hour ) . i get so many compliments on these chairs ! ! 
i did n't get instructions either ! amazon had me contact the manufacturer and they did n't respond . they were ok to assemble , look at the screw holes , in the front of the seat they are closer together than in the back . do n't fully tighten the screws until you have all 4 in . good luck ! 
i 'm not sure what the weight limit is . if we would 've been able to get the chairs put together , we 'd have tested them out . the holes in the base made it impossible for them to be assembled . we returned them . : ( 
probably . i would be a little worried about the metal legs if they were in the rain , though . 
people have had problems with using the k-cup adapter portion of the solofil v2 . their brewers are not destroyed just clogged . i have a solution . the clogging happened to my v500 . i have found a way to fix the issue . the problem is that the needle that punches the top of the k-cup gets clogged . this happens because the vue positions the k-cup in the brewer sidways so the needle is in a position for grounds to get into it . this does n't happen with vue cups because the area where the needle punches into the vue cup has an indent of filter material that prevents grounds coming in contact with the needle . it also does not happen in the k-cup brewers because those brewers position the k-cup upright when brewing . the fix is to unfold a paper clip and rod out the needle hole . this can be done by opening the top of the brewer and inserting the end of the paper clip in the hole of the needle ( flashlight needed ) . once you have inserted it move it in and out a few times , remove , close the brewer and brew an 8oz cup with nothing in the machine . you will see loose grounds in the cup . everything should work now until it happens again ( unfortunately it will ) . 
either would work . i chose the v2 for my v700 . by being able to brew k cups , i now have a wider variety of flavors i can brew . 
it works great with using your own coffee or even tea ( leaves ) it works ok with using the k-cups , sometimes they do n't brew so great but if your purpose for it is using loose coffee it 's great 
yes it works on all keurig vue brewing machines . i was excited to finally find a refill cup for the vue ( v600 ) 
the v2 includes an adapter that allows you to use k-cup portion packs by just pushing them into the solofill and using it in the vue . first remove the the solofill cover and filter and then place the k-cup adapter in the solofill , then push the k-cup on to a sharp point that punctures the bottom of the k-cup . then `` brew . '' the v1 did not have the adapter . 
this unit is filterless as everything is easily removable for washing . it is recommended to wash the unit once per every 4 full tanks of use with vinegar and hot water . 
yes it just come out of the spout on the top . you can adjust the amount of mist that comes out . i adjust ours down , because it puts out a lot of mist . we love ours ! ! 
about a day in full power and almost two days on the lowest setting . 
yep 
yes 
i have n't found any humidifiers that are truly easy to clean ... but this one is more convenient than most . i clean it frequently and just stay on top of it ... .i am happy with this purchase . 
i emailed customer service and they said yes it is bpa-free . 
yes , if you cook them too long . my suggestion would be to simply cook the soup w out the zucchini noodles ; then at the very last minute , put them in the soup and simmer for only one minute to warm them . 
no it did n't . but the design allowed me to use my regular dishwashing brush , the type that dispenses soap , cleaning was easy . hope that helps . 
yes , it 's safe in the top rack of the dishwasher . 
i do n't know exact measurements , but i would compare them to spaghetti and linguine noodles . hope that helps . 
it does n't indicate so on the item or in the little booklet that came with it . good question.. 
you can definitely leave the skin on ... comes out fabulous ! 
the trundle can be placed on either side of the bed . 
wood plastic and leather 
yes , adults can sleep away on this bed . i weigh 236 and her mother weighs 147 and have been sleeping in this bed since we moved until our bedroom set arrives . 
it is lower . the trundle slides out from beneath the platform and remains on the floor . there is no ability to raise the trundle . 
you need a full size mattress for the top bed and a twin mattress for the bottom trundle bed . so one full mattress and one twin mattress . 
no the trundle is a full . 
yes and my daughter loves it 
yes it is ... .bought for my granddaughter and she loves it ! you can measure the dimensions of your bed and compare it with the dimensions of the comforter ... hope that helps . 
no it does n't 
this is the mattress only . a platform bed would be the best option for this mattress as it is foam . box springs will not work with this mattress . i have two mattresses from this company , the other being latex and for both beds i have cut 2 x 4 's to fit on top of the side rails for my beds for the mattresses to lay on . this works very well and is much less expensive than purchasing a new bed frame or the solid box to put the mattress on . 
yes , it is , and it 's very comfortable 
not at all . 
yes 
it did n't take long . recommended is 24-48 hrs but my girls slept on them 10 hrs later and they were firm and full by then . they have also kept their form . 
not really sure . i purchased a platform for the mattress . i can say that this is extremely comfortable . i have had guests over the weekend and i slept on it . truly is amazingly comfortable and cozy . 
no filter . filter basket . 
hello its better then my betty crocker coffee maker it does n't taste burt after a couple of hours .i hope this helps you 
no the underside is fabric with a tag and the top is not flat . 
i have had grown adults & children sit on it often . i guess most weight would be about 180 lbs 
it is a flat surface , but it is a felt like material , i do n't think i would put any liquid on it . it also is not designed to be used as a tray , in my opinion it does not sit stable enough on top of the ottoman to use that way . 
my best guess is 3-5 pounds . the lid ( cushion part ) is actually the heavier portion . 
mine was shipped with other items so i ca n't be too specific , but it was flattened in the package and not much larger than say ... a frozen pizza . 
i took the lid off and measured from the bottom to the top , and it is just over 13 inches deep . if whatever you planned to put in was taller that 13 inches , you would not be able to put the lid back on securely . 
no 
it folds easily and is very sturdy . perfect for small spaces such as an rv , camper etc . 
i have n't had to use liners . i spray the pans with non-stick spray when i make omelet muffins , and today i made cupcakes and sprayed them with wilton 's bake easy ( the equivalent of flouring a pan ) . they came out fine . you can use liners if you want tho . 
10x13in 
they are graduated . 
the measurements are 2 & 5 8ths at top and 2 inches at the bottom . 
yes , top shelf 
yes , it fits . i have both this muffin pan and the breville 800xl toaster oven . 
really do n't know , i assume it is bpa free because it is a premium silicone pan . 
each cup holds about 2.5 oz or 75 ml per cup . it 's really not the most efficient for freezing broth because i 'd rather have about a cup at a time . but i could n't find a muffin pan that large . but if you want small amounts , it works very well . 
a tamper , the ss drain pan , under overflow pan , the water container , the water container cover , the coffee basket ( handle ) and 2 coffee grind interior cups . ( one for single shots and the larger cup for double shots ) it 's a real good non-auto espresso machine . it 's even good enough for small restaurants 
there is space for the mug if you remove the tray . 
hsd is the new model it 's the same with very small difference , you ca n't go wrong with either one , specially if the price is to high.ps must buy a good grinder ! sc 
no 
just stick the food in and turn , stainless steel blades spiral cut as you turn , just like sharpening a pencil except bigger . 
the box says china . 
i 've put in in the top rack -- but you really need to use the brush that comes with it , even so . lots of little nooks to get clean . i hope this helps . 
the slicer , the top and a cleaning tool . the cook books are e-books . 
about two inches is `` wasted '' . it comes to a point where you can no longer grip the item with hands or the tool . it is n't a waste really if you dice the remainder . 
have used the swifter disposable cloths for sweeping dusting . they work just fine , but like the device better for wet mopping . generally just use the blue cloth it came w and others like i ordered off amazon . they wash well in my washing machine . 
brushing these is enough , i think you do n't need to wash these with clorx . 
the are the microfiber clothes that you wet yourself and attach to the i-robot brava rechargeable floor mopping machine . 
i would n't think so . the braava manual states the blue textured cloths are for mopping , white cloths are for dry sweeping . 
it works with a european version . 
hello ret - it is manufactured in china . hope that helps . mike . 
overall pan is 20 1 4 `` x 14 `` . inside is 18 '' x 13 '' . grill sits inside pan . 
i am not sure why but it appears that the cooling rack can be used up to 350 degrees . as to the broiler , perhaps it is because of the aluminum . i have not used this one under the broiler not even my neighbor . if it requires 450 what are you making , i will suggest using another pan such as farberware or good cook which are inexpensive and work fine even under the broiler . 
helli linda - bakeware is safe up to 450 degrees . do not use under the broiler . cooling rack is safe to 350 degrees . do not use under the broiler . hope that helps . mike . 
hello deborah - that should not be a problem . beat wishes -mike 
no , and no again , i cook a lot of chinese food , and when i try to slice chicken , the meat sticks to the blade with each slice and you have to stop and pull it off . wish i had not wasted my money . works on some vegetables . would i recommend it to any one . no i would not . 
it is real sharp , but i have problems with the spaces in the center . i use it more for cheese , but not for other things . 
answer ? what is the question ? which knife is better ? i have no idea , at least about a randall or a topps , never heard of either of those . i know for sure that the aero knife , at least the one i got , is just about useless . 
no you ca n't i 'm afraid . i 've used my knife for almost every kitchen chore . and so far , it 's shown no sign of dulling.i give the knife 5 stars for holding an edge 
i purchased these for my daughter 's tea party this past april . i would say in can hold 18 - 24 depending on how they are arranged . very sturdy ! 
12 1 2 '' tall when fully assembled . 
good old really strong and nice looking bpa free , fda approved , food safe , dishwasher safe plastic . these are very nice ! 
yes , there 's nothing inherent about the plastic that would not allow it to be painted . i just ca n't speak to the prep that would be required so that the paint would stick the best . 
there is a hole where you put the risers , if you use a doily you can cover up the hole and use as separate dishes , you can separate into two layers if needed . 
the top tier is about 4 to 4.5 inches the middle tier is about 6 to 6.5 inches , and the bottom tier is about 8.5 to 9.5 inches . i hope this helps ! 
yes without the riser . 
hello , the frame is made of steel tubes with durable wipe clean polyester fabric . hope this can help you . 
no difference . 
wow , , , that was not my experience . the one i purchased worked perfectly fine . 
yes 
i am not sure if it would or not as i do not know what that model is . i can only say that if you find it takes a 7.2 volt battery , it `` might . '' i hope this helps though i have n't given you much to go on . i would suggest you do some searching online for the model you are asking about . 
no 
they do not make it in brown . we have red , white and black . 
they are both correct . whichever color you purchase , you will get the design pictured . 
china . thank you . 
yes , mine came with a loop 
about 14.75 inches 
a single one 
no . i have looked at it again and it just has an anti-slip pattern on the surface . 
yes it is . 
yes , also great product . 
yes , these covers are very hot already . but , i must admit both my wife and u have warm blood . 
hello - thank you for your interest in designer living . please see care instructions below : machine wash cold , gentle cycle , and separately . do not bleach . tumble dry low , remove promptly . do not iron . if there is no free movement in the washer or dryer , use large capacity commercial washer dryer . sincerely , krystal designer living customer service rep 1-888-879-8790 
i can not see why it would not work as long as you can live with the specific hourly time restrictions of 8 , 4 , 2 , or 1 hours . you can not work with minutes , i.e . 2 hours and 30 minutes . being rated at 15 amps , i can not imagine your overloading the unit in your application . my wife uses ours two or three times a week and we have not had a problem . so i think they have built a good unit . 
hello , i love the timer . i use it all the time on my bedside light to help me stop reading and get some sleep ! : - ) hope this helped . 
works great ! 
yes , it is ul approved 
yes 
14.5 '' , 5.5 '' , 8 '' 
nope 
they are wide enough for artisan breads but no bagels . hope that helps . but fyi i returned this bc bread english muffins fell off the lifter ( whatever its called ) and got stuck almost every time and to get it out you have to cut the bread into tiny pieces while its stuck in there and its rediculous ! plus even if you dont have to dig your bread out , the crumb catcher doesnt work my counter was a disaster i wrote a negative review i would not recomend this at all . 
coils , and it broke 
i am not sure , but all i can say is they are good spoons for soup . i try to go usa also , but sometimes i ca n't find what i want that way . 
i chose to buy this set specifically because all of the spoons were the same size . my wife is ataxic , and needs to use spoons more than any other type of flatware . however because of her problem , we lose spoons down the garbage disposal a little too often . having a set with different sized flatware would be of no use to me . 
medium weight , a simple and very usable design . 
the depth of the bowl is about 1 3 '' . 
i believe so . 
i 'm 5'9 , if you want to use it to maybe cover feet up and most of chest while watching a movie , then yes . its about 6 feet long , so after a sleepy night of moving around , it wont cover you all that well . its super soft , and i love mine . 
china . i did not know that before i bought it . 
regular pillow cases will fit . 
medium is 24x13x4 ( on the thick side ) or 2 on the other side . large is 24x13x5 ( on the thick side ) i love this pillow ! no odor . cool and comfy . perfect . no fluffing necessary ever ! soooo much better than a regular pillow . my daughter got one of those $ 150 tempurpedic pillows which she loves but she has no problems sleeping or has an neck pain - and she can sleep in any position . i ca n't sleep on it . this thing is great ! i primarily sleep on my side but this thing is even great if you sleep on your belly . enjoy 
i am not sure if it might vary with different size pillows . mine is a medium and it is 4 inches on the high end and 2 inches on the lower end . 
memory foam is memory foam which is polyurethane and added chemicals increasing it 's viscosity . 
the pillow is made in china . and to be very blunt , do n't buy it . it is not memory foam . 
i do n't know , i bought the medium size pillow . 
yes . and a cover to the grinder jar is also included . the grinder jar and cover can be used to store ground coffee in the refrigerator , 
yes , the beans and grinds have contact with plastic 
yes . it does . sectional , chair , coffee table 
do not buy this ! ! its a lemon and the most uncomfortable thing we ever had the misfortune to sit on ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
no , it only comes as you see here in stock . you can do a custom order for another color , it takes approximately 12 weeks to make and the price may change depending on the colors and material . thank you 
this set is a top grain leather . then places you do n't normally touch are a leather match . this is a very nice set . home style for less 
yes it comes with 5 large cushions and 2 small throw pillows as pictured . thank you , home styles for less 
we just ship to points in the continental u.s with our free delivery . we can ship into canada for an extra charge . there are freight forwarding companies that will accept the items in the u.s and ship to other countries , but that would have to be arranged on your own . thank you , home style for less 
yes , it fits over the mattress , it has a generous size stretchy banding 
hello , this is going to fit like a fitted sheet , to help keep it held into place . thank you for inquiring . 
2.5 inches according to the exceptionalsheets website . some reviewers here on amazon are confusing this one with the extra plush only version . this one is the thicker one . 
the difference between the two is the double thick topper is twice the thickness of the bamboo topper . the bamboo topper also has a top that is 70 % polyester 30 % rayon from bamboo and is perfect for anyone who has trouble sleeping due to night sweats or getting overly warm when in bed because of the excellent breathability of the material . 
all i can say is that it feels like a pillow top bed . i feel like i 'm sleeping on a cloud . 
too soft for babies and toddlers 
i try to find the matching shams but could not . i use my country rose shams and it still looks great but would love to find the matching ones . 
hi eric , thanks for your question about our available colors for our travel pillow . currently we can offer you our popular light purple colored neck pillow . we will also have a dark blue option in around 6 weeks from now . best regards , jude the crafty world team 
this pillow is great but doesnt really squish that much . i carry it on the plane with me . its more like a memory foam . hope that helps 
maybe -- i have never tried it -- it is actually too thick for me -- not comfortable ! ! ! 
yes . it would . 
11.6 ounces according to my postal weighing scale . 
does not come with mattress . i 'm happy with it ! just what i wanted . 
they seem very sturdy . we 've used our daybeds as sleeping beds for adults with no problem . 
it was very easy ! i did it myself and it took about an hour . i also put together the trundle that goes with it . it 's a great deal ! 
no . it does not . all you get is the frame . 
yes 
yes - it should fit , from the bottom of the bed rail to the floor there is a 14.5 inch clearance . most trundle bed frames and mattress need 12 inches . 
24 hours 
2 '' . sorry , i could n't resist . actually , we have had both and the 13 '' provides much more support and comfort for everyday use . i use the 11 '' in my guest room but the 13 '' is my nightly friend ! 
yes 
no 
yes , definitely ... just make sure you 've got enough slats to support it properly . ( btw , this is a *great* mattress ! ! ) 
i know this was asked a while ago , but i emailed the seller after i received the mattress ( which , i have only been sleeping on for two days but am very happy with so far ) . they emailed back that the 7-inch base layer of high-density foam is a 4lb density ... not sure about the others , but the base layer is most important when determining the overall durability , comfort , etc . i consider 4lb to be perfect for me , as that is on the medium-firm side . 
the information that came with the pan says not to wash it in the dishwasher . cleanup is so easy though with soap and hot water . nothing sticks to it . i really like this brand . 
dear paula , thank you for your inquiry . the measurements you requested are approximately 11 inches . thank you for allowing us to service you . tonia d. consumer relations . 
paula , was a bit hard , since the pan inside , curves up the sides but best as i could measure without worrying of scratching , it is 8 1 2 inches flat surface . on outside bottom pan it is 8 3 4 inches . 
16 ounces if you fill it full . 14 ounces of coffee puts it about an inch from the brim . 
the mug itself is all stainless steel . just the lid is plastic 
i have a lot of contigo travel mugs and i really do n't think you 'd be able to use a west loop for anything more than coffee , tea or water or a soft drink ( do n't tell contigo but i use the west loop for soft drinks all the time . most of the time i do n't use the lid but there are times when i need to leave and there 's just too much to throw away , so , top on and out the door i go . no problems with that so far ! ) i would suggest one of the water bottles that have the built in straw or the shake and go tumbler that has the amazing top that again does n't spill or leak . they come with a hard plastic straw . there is a new water bottle now that is glass and has a wider opening with a screw-on lid . it 's called the purity water bottle and it 's really nice . go to the contigo web site gocontigo.com and have a look around . i think you 'll find something there that will meet your needs . plus , no offense to amazon but the shipping is must faster when you order directly from the company . hope this helps ! you know ... i should probably work for this company ! i 've answered many questions for their products . : ) 
i 've got a normal size cup holder in my kia optima , yes it fits fine . 
no not at all . has a good safety button to lock it shut when transporting it . 
i did n't have any problems with sheets . they fit well . 
it 's a regular fill size mattress . we use full size sheets for it . 
i bought the dream foam mattress in the 10 inch version . i have a cranky back and find it difficult to get comfortable . this mattress did the trick for me . i would call it medium firm with just enough give for sleeping on your side . its wonderful . 
my daughter sleeps comfortably on this mattress and has not complained of overheating while sleeping on it .

yes they are . 
yes it will , my sons is a twin and it fits great ! ! 
i believe it is standard , that 's what i have in my sons pillow case and it fits fine . 
no full size is smaller than a queen . and this full size quilt is a little smaller than most full size quilts . it probably would fit a twin perfectly . but i still love it for my sons bed . 
yes it came with one 
no it 's thickness is actually pretty decent and i will sometimes use it as my primary blanket when i sleep so i do n't think it 's itchy at all . 
i have not purchased any curtains yet . we just have blinds up . we are decorating our room with a gray and yellow theme . i 'm looking for curtains with both dark and light gray with some yellow in it . 
it 's full it 's not oversized 
no , it is a comforter . 
i do n't know . you would have to contact the company that made it . it 's light weight , and that 's what i wanted . i do n't like heavy bedspreads or comforters that are heavy and bulky . i do n't use it when i sleep . i fold it down to the end of the bed so it wo n't get all wrinkled up . i 'm very picky , and i really like this . i got the orange and it looks great . i have n't washed it yet , so we 'll see how that goes . 
the color looks gray . good luck 
these pillowcases do not have zippers- it is the standard clothe foldover on the back 
microwave oven is 20 '' 3 8 wide , 12 '' 1 2 high including feet , 14 '' 3 4 deep . sorry for the delay the oven is in my vacation home . 
it 's approximately 12 and quarter inches ... hope this helps 
yes and it is big enough to fit a dinner plate . i had a smaller one and it was just too small . i need to add that there is a timer feature that i use often because the timer on my stove is very low volume . 
about 40 inches . 
no . 
end 
yes , the cord is a high temp cord that can go in an oven , bbq or smoker . 
when batteries are installed it will come on but not register a temp . gives you the desired temp for each possible meat . 
hey shawn , no the display is not back-lit . 
the probe cord is made of a plastic material , so i would not advise it . 
it comes with all the hardware you will need . they include some extra and everything is nicely labeled . various sized hardware is included for mounting your tv as well . 
yes 
i just have a berber carpet in basement where i have the stand- but it 's very stable . you can adjust the front legs to level out- the glass is heavy enough to keep it stable also . 
yes , it will hold 50 inch , but check with seller first . 
it 's the length of the height of the chest of drawers , but it weights a lot ! ! 
metal . i put this together myself pretty easily . time consuming , but the directions are great . 
i 'm sorry we do n't ship overseas . you may check with other amazon distributors . 
assembly takes some time - about 2 hours - but is not complicated . directions are clear and straightforward . 
it depends on the `` store '' you buy it from . from bestfurniturebuys , we ship in 2-3 working days and it would take 1-4 days to receive depending on what state you live in . 
the outside dimensions are 31 '' wide , 17 5 8 '' deep and 49 3 4 '' tall . 
no 
500 degrees 
i have not turned over the items i have cooked on it . i have mostly used this for frozen french fries or warming up those that i could not finish from a cafe . i have also warmed up fried chicken and it seemed to regain its crispyness . i warmed up pizza but did not notice that it got crispy . 
it only contains one mat . i love this thing for getting crunchy french fries out of my toaster oven . 
i believe only one ... 
yes you put it right on shelf . you could put those items on but you would need to put something under it while taking it out because it is not sturdy . 
i am sure it would , however i have only used in my convection oven , works awesome ! 
yes , they cut really easily with scissors . 
i wash mine in the sink with a little woolite & downy.hang to dry . it does n't take long 
it is a generous 20 x 30 inches . 
the tag reads `` 100 % silk '' . you 'd have to ask the manufacturer if that is synonymous with 100 % mulberry silk . 
no 
i do n't know because i bought king size but they are big enough so i assume the queen 's would be too . they are excellent quality . 
william , i only bought the king sized . the length is 33 '' and the width is 19 '' . do not know about the other sizes . they are wonderful so good luck ! 
the best way to determine if your monitor is representing the right color is to double check on another computer . different computer screens can give different color hues on the same picture . 
the queen size is 90 x 90 '' and the king size is 110 x 90 '' . all other measurements are listed in the description , down towards the bottom . 
this one is hard ... slate blue teal tinted ? it is not stark blue-aqua . gray tinted teal ? sorry i can not be more specific . 
comforter , 2 shams , 4 decorative pillows , bedskirt 
if i recall correctly you get two regular pillowcases , two euro pillowcases , three decorative pillows and the comforter . sheets are not included . 
yes 
as a barber i 've used a hot towel warmer for years . my preferred method is to fold the towel twice over , wet it , roll it , and wring it out , then put in the warmer . without wringing it out it would be too hot and drippy . dry it would n't hold it 's heat once out . plus ... this is n't the sort of towel warmer to use for say ... warming a bath towel . more of a hand , neck , or face towel warmer . hope that was helpful 
yes . we have 2 units that the heating element went out . you might be better to shop around some more . 
2 prong plug 
yes , the inside bottom is flat and smooth . the top is wider than bottom , the green one in the picture is example of finished item , you can see directly from the picture . sincerely , seller : allforhome 
hi there , the finished soap about 400 g. sincerely , seller : allforhome 
it 's a true twin fit , but when u put a twin comforter inside , it 's seem to be a little too small so it 's bunches up ? hope this help ! 
we can confirm that it is for the duvet cover sheet only , ( duvet not included ) , and a matching pillowcase . 
a duvet is like a large pillowcase for a comforter . 
hi vero ! great question . yes they will make it in a 460f oven temperature under normal use with a couple of points to keep in mind . we tested our mats at higher temperatures than 480f which is why we felt confident rating them at a top heat resistance of 480f . that being said , if you use them as an oven liner even at a temperature lower than 460f they will become damaged because they will be too close to the heating element of most stoves . also , if the food you are cooking on them burns ( for any reason food may normally burn in the oven ) the mats will be damaged even if the temperature was below 460f . i hope this answers your question ! 
the mats are made in china and pass all food and drug administration regulations by undergoing a commodities check before they are allowed into the united states . 
hi sheila . great question . the mat is smooth . the back side is shiny which keeps it from moving around on your counter top . the top side that has the markings on it is a `` matte '' finish and the markings are smooth so if you gently run your finger across the mat you will feel a textural difference , but no ridges . if you were to roll out your pastry or dough on the mat and then flip the pastry over to inspect the side that was against the mat , you would not see any lines from the measurement markings . and if you happen to have a tile counter top that makes it almost impossible to roll out pastry smoothly , you will find that the pastry mat will allow you to roll out your pastry and not see any of those grout lines in your dough either . when we did our testing , this was one of the issues that we most wanted to address ! i hope this answers your question ! 
its about 19 inches x 16 inches . a tiny bit more perhaps . 
i do n't know . but it is fairly light and i would think the water jets would blow it all over and get it tangled up . it is easy enough to clean and set in a strainer . 
it 's approximately 1 16 of an inch thick , and it is very sturdy . 
machine wash cold , tumble dry low 
thanks for your question ! this comforter is queen size . the same one is also available in king size here : http : www.amazon.com dp b00hb9gpjs i hope this helps ! 
the actual mirror is 9.5 inches wide , by 42 inches tall . the entire cabinet stands 57 inches tall , and is 16 inches across . you did n't ask this , but i 'll offer it up -- i totally love this cabinet . so easy to assemble , and a perfect and classy display for all my jewelry ! 
yes it does 
very good 
they 're functional but very shallow , they are very easy to pull completely out . but they slide right back in . 
yes it does . i absolutely love it ! i highly recommend getting one . 
glass i do n't think it can be plastic 
no 
yes there is lipped ledges and drawers 
i ca n't say for sure but my gf does have a ton of jewelry in there . 
it measures 18-1 8 '' x 11-3 8 '' x 3 4 '' and was made in china 
mine measures 22.5 inches from outside of handle to outside of handle . 
approx 2 inches , also i just want to add this is a great heavy duty griddle , it does n't warp like all the other griddles i have had . it is also easy to clean . 
nothing ever sticks . i just soak in warm soap water . 
i do n't know what they are..but i am very pleased with the performance of this griddle so far , we have used it twice on a double burner gas range . i used to have a cheap griddle but it warped and rocked on the burners . 
there embroidered the material . i love the bedspread and get many complants on it . 
yes 
its microfiber ... 
this quilted bedspread has a very light ivory background ... .definitely not white 
yes just order this and send me an email that you wany the king size.. 
your dimensions are the correct ones , 26.18 wide 11.62 deep and 15,37 height . these are great ! i 've got them in the 2-tier and 3-tier , i 'll buy more of the 3-tier because they clear my husband dress shirts and slacks and there 's enough room under for flip flops & slippers , almost like having 4 rows . 
no . i tried to stack it on the 3-tier shoe rack and failed . there 's about 0.3 inch gap between those two shoe racks . 
the clearance from the floor to the underside of the first shelf is 6.25 '' . the shelf thickness is about .25 '' . the clearance between the second shelf and the underside of the top shelf is about the same , about 6.13. all ample size for good visibility . boots would have to go on the top shelf . the overall dimensions of the unit are 26.25 '' wide , 11.75 '' deep and 15 '' tall . i use this unit for on the floor , versus the three shelf unit that i believe they suggest as the base unit . 
do n't buy it , terribly constructed . breaks easily . 
i would not advise it . 
the aluminum was sandwiched between two stainless steel layers . the bottom stainless steel layer is magnetic making this cookware induction compatible . 
this quality build product is manufactured in china . 
yes , that is what i use , and i love my pans ! 
yes , although i generally wash by hand . 
i have n't had a problem with scrambled eggs but did with something else . i used barkeepers friend and a non-scratch scrubber with excellent results . hope this helps . 
dear lindsay , these come with flat bottom , and it is designed for working on flat glass-top stove . thank you . 
hello suzette , each spoon and spatula in the set is 12 inches long . thank you for your inquiry . 
no i do n't think so 
dear mrs. diaz , our products premium bamboo are only sold on amazon.com . we are not selling in any store . what you saw in store is another product that was not manufactured by premium bamboo . one of our images on amazon has a picture of our spoons in a mesh bag with a green label . thank you ! sean premium bamboo 
i contacted the company and the response was all products are made in china 
i do n't have a box spring with it , but it 's on a bed frame with wooden slats and works well . 
i am not too sure about it folding far enough and adjusting to the sitting position of a hospital bed like would work . the mattress is great , a bit firm but contours to your body . i know enough about hospital beds so i can tell you from the heart , this might not work . hospital beds have thinner mattresses so maybe you would be better off with a 5 inch one . the mattress is also quite heavy to handle by one person . i hope this helps some ! good luck ! isabel 
one piece ... just like a regular spring mattress 
perhaps a too mushy condition , would result , ,at the moment this mattress provides excellent softness initiatilly , and firmness at deeper penetration weight , perhaps for a medical condition , dictating furthur absorbtion , it may be advantagious , ,however for me it is perfect , as is , ! ! a foam pillow set , would be my choice in the next step , for the perfect ensemble , ! ! alan moreton , ! ! 
futon mattresses are designed to fold . this one is not . you might make it work if you strapped it down at the fold and at both ends but its 8 inches thick and will only fold with difficulty . i would n't try it . 
yes it is . 
the scale comes with an app that syncs via bluetooth and imports your weight . i have not been able to sync to the health app or to other fitness apps like loseit . 
it reads in tenths . 
2-aa batteries 
i take my ipad in once a week to sync the data . it 'll store the data until then . 
no 
no , no support for healthkit as of now . customer support representative says it might be added to an update . 
no 
the pro chef nicer dicer plus is manufactured in china ( guangdong province ) using finely tempered 420-grade stainless steel imported from japan . our factory is certified , compliant with all international labor standards , and has specialized in manufacturing kitchenware , cooking tools , injection molded food slicers and dicers , ( in addition to more than 20 diversified product lines ) , for more than 20 years . the pro chef nicer dicer plus brand retained independent component and ingredient analysis from the french national laboratories . the fnl confirmed that all constituent assembly parts of the finished product exceeded international engineering academy standards in all categories . we hope this answers your question and , as stated in our response to a prior inquiry , we offer you a full 30-day unconditional money-back guarantee on the pro chef nicer dicer plus . we hope you will give it a try -- risk free ! 
hi silvia -- great question , in part , because the answer discloses the core uniqueness and the key factor that distinguishes the pro chef nicer dicer plus from all other nicer dicers on the market today . and the answer is : as of today , no . as we are fond of saying , `` if it 's not black and white , its just not right ! '' when the product development team at new world cuisine set out to re-design the nicer dicer , we had one simple objective : design the very best food dicer possible regardless of price , then make it affordable to serious folks who love cooking as much as we do and who appreciate the value their time that will be saved by using the dicer . we carefully studied more than one thousand customer reviews from folks all over the world who purchased a nicer dicer during the 2012 13 production cycle . we found that there were two clear issues driving the customer experience into negative territory . one was the flimsy plastic casing and the other centered on problems with the steel blades . the blades were not securely encased in the abs casing and oftentimes would break , rust , or become too loose to or dull to cut . after evaluating the customer experiences , we set about to design structural changes that would address both areas of concern while also improving its overall performance dramatically . the result is the product that we released last month under the brand pro chef nicer dicer plus . we used a maximum strength multi-polymer abs plastic casing to enshrine the highest grade 420 stainless steel blades ( rather than the 301 stainless used by genius and other smaller competing brands . ) . the result is nothing short of spectacular . in all respects , the pro chef brand of nicer dicer plus outperforms all other products hands down . it is stronger , sharper , and easier to use than any other device in its class . so , bringing the color question full circle . most nicer dicers from model year 2012 and 2013 are green and white , with some appearing late last year in burgundy red and purple ( genius products on e-bay and qvc ) . we wanted to make sure that the pro chef brand stood out not only in terms of quality and performance , but also in terms of its appearance . we also wanted there to be no doubt in our customers mind that our product , the pro chef brand , was uniquely the best one available . we made it black and white , and that way , you know it 's right ! we offer an unmatched , best of market guarantee as well . so give us a try , risk free ! if , for any reason , you are not completely satisfied , let us know within 30 days and we will gladly refund your purchase price ! thanks , rich mathias , for new world cuisine . 
you can make two sizes of cubes - about 1 4 inch and about 1 2 inch . it works really well if you do n't overload it . 
the mandolin style slicer provides a one-size slicing solution and it is quite thin . if you push a little harder on the slicing platform , you will achieve a slightly thicker slice , but not appreciably thicker . so it is best considered a one-size mandolin slicer . - rich mathias 
i 'm not quite sure what vg rating you are referring to in your question . what i do know is that our 420 stainless steel sources from japan and that the quality and grade rating was confirmed independently by the jiangsu puv product services laboratory , shenzen branch . i will check into the `` vg '' rating issue and update this answer if necessary . thanks , rich mathias , for new world cuisine . 
the warranty and return policy for this pro chef nicer dicer plus include not only the complete amazon a-z guaranty , but we go a big step further . we are so convinced that you will love this product , that we are extending a 30-day return warranty -- if , for any reason , you are not happy with this product , you may return it to us for a complete refund of your purchase price within 30-days of your date of purchase . try this amazing dicer risk free -- you will love it or i will take it back . rich mathias . 
yes . all of the cutting pieces , the bonus peeler , and the bonus free stainless steel grater , all fit inside the container , which also includes the sealing lid for storage of your remaining diced or sliced foods in the fridge . 
i would not suggest that . you could crack the plastic or even distort the cutting blades . my guess is that the blades are tempered . 
yes 
i have not experienced this scale exhibit memory that affects subsequent results . 
you get a food processor with three interlocking bowls . there is an accessory kit with a storage case . there is one slicing blade where you can dial thickness from thin to thick . there is a reversible shredding blade and you can shred in two thicknesses . there are two chopping blades ; one for each of the two bowls you use for shopping . there is a dough blade and the dicing kit and a plastic pusher to clean the dicing kit . there is a spatula and a basic manual . there are no recipes in the manual . 
no . there is a plastic pusher that comes with the dicer and most of the debris snaps out . you can use a tiny brush or a metal skewer to clean the rest . with soft vegetables like potato , you will not have to do anything more . 
it is made of metal and it 's very heavy . 
there are actually 3 openings - each nested inside the next one larger . the smallest is circular and about 4 cm in diameter . the next one up is a rounded rectangle that 's about 7.5 cm by 5.5 cm . the largest one is a half circle - the point to point on the crescent is 16.5 cm and at the widest point in the middle it is 7 cm . 
in the main bowl up to 10 cups of thin liquid and up to 15 cups of thick liquid , in the small prep bowl up to 4 cups of liquid . 
no . i asked the customer service rep at ka and there is no plans for a larger dicer . however , you can purchase the french fry disk . this produces a short rectangle cut . you can then cut those into two or three pieces for a dice . 
i think so , i know it can grate hard cheeses . i have only tried onions , celery , apples , bell peppers so far 
you should , but they come pre-treated with mineral oil ... 
i do n't know the exact answer to your question . however , i purchased the small board from home goods and was so ill from the smell of it that i had to put it in my garage , then return it . horrible odor , horrible symptoms . if you have chemical allergies , exercise caution .

i think it would work - the shower curtain is sewn together with a cream colored lbacking adds more weight and helps the curtain hang nicely . hope this helps ? ! 
i think yellow and gold are forgotten colors , really . i could n't find yellow either and i ended up getting a pink , a blue and a white pillow ... they look good ! 
it has a lot of burgundy and a small amount of violet ( very light purple ) . 
no you dont ... the liner is attached to material . 
no 
yes ! i use this exclusively to make cold brew coffee . it 's a longer process , but you put about 1 3 cup grinds in with a full beaker of cold or room temperature filtered water . put the lid on , but do n't press down the plunger . let the coffee steep overnight at room temperature ( or for a full 24 hours in the fridge ) . in the morning , press the plunger down and you 'll have a coffee concentrate to keep in your fridge . it 's great over ice because it does n't water down like hot coffee . 
the plunger stem unthreads at the base where the screens are held in place and also at the ball tip . be extra careful when twisting the pieces to unthread as there is a small bolt securing the screen attachements . i also recommend working over a tray , so as not to loose or misplace any of the small pieces . the white insulated layer is also removable from the stainless steel dome cap . keep track of all the pieces when disassembling to ensure you have everthing to reassemble once all the pieces have been thoroughly cleaned . 
just the top of the lid . the contact would be minimal . 
made in china is on the bottom of the box 
oh dear , the answer by adrienne douke is completely wrong . espresso is a method of brewing very concentrated coffee by using a high pressure to force a small amount of water through finely ground coffee . a french press can not make true espresso . you can improvise and use finely ground coffee and a little bit of water and steep together in the french press , but it will not be the same . espresso is not a type of roast , unless your talking about the trademarked 'roast ' that companies like starbucks sell . this creates an unfortunate misconception that 'espresso ' is a type of roast . starbucks has chosen a particular blend of beans that when pulled as espresso shots , gives the flavor of a dark caramelized roast , hence 'espresso roast ' . starbucks has deemed that this is the best flavor profile for their espresso drinks . however , this is not a universal expression of espresso . actually , many flavor profiles can be created by the espresso method and they tend to taste so much better than the starbucks 'espresso ' roast . in conclusion , a french press is a method of brewing coffee , just like drip , pour-over , and espresso . and just like how each brewing method changes the dynamics of the brewed coffee drastically , the french press takes on its own profile . it 's one of the simplest and best methods for brewing regular coffee . the key is to use coarsely ground ( using a burr or conicial grinder ) quality beans ( not folgers or the like ) , and the proper ratio of grounds to water . if its too dark , just dilute with more water after the brew process . 
the sterlingpro replacement glass beaker is supplied on amazon now . the current price is $ 15.85 . if you search `` sterlingpro coffee press '' , you will find the replacement beaker . 
i used on my 9000 btu frigidaire . i think these are universal . 
simply place it flat against the siding and bolt it in . we did it and it worked perfectl 
this should . i did a 12k unit . the bolt holes give flexibility for many different sized units and it should support the weight . it was pretty easy to install and comes with concrete anchors if you need them . i put mine into wood so i just got a few long stainless wood screws . 
i purchased 2 27000 20 seer unit and i am very happy with them . i am a certified a c mechanic . i mounted one condenser over the other using one set of brackets . i had to modify the installation . specks specify the the condenser is to be mounted 11.5 `` from any wall but the brackets only allow 8 '' so i purchased the shocks and mounted to the wall and then the bracket to the mounts . just for safety i installed a long lag thru the mount directly into the side of the house . if the rubber mount were to fail the lag would act as a safety . i think if i were to do it again i would have the had the brackets made to accommodate the specks . it 's working fine but it ' only been installed for 2+ months . the units are fine . 
enough for air flow . they work well . 
sorry i returned them cuz thy started to peel from the inside 
so sorry cont remember..i am taking them back to costco n ordering life time from regal ware 
yes , it is stitched in a number of places . i have n't washed it yet though , so i ca n't comment on how well it holds up to washing . 
i doubt it . mine is a queen and it fits well . it would be too short i assume on a king 
it comes with shams for the standard and european style pillows , but it does come with small decorative pillows . 
it is more of a whiter background but not a stark white . i bought sheets at bbb in slate that go well with the grey in the spread . it is not a heavy comforter which is good for my flashes ! 
alex , the filling is listed as 100 % polyester on the tag . have a good day ! 
no . . .you must use a pressure canner for meats , poultry and fish . this unit is n't a pressure canner . 
it is a pressurized canner , not a pressure canner . big difference . this only goes to 3 psi . most pressure canning recipes require 12-15 psi . this is a replacement for the water-bath method . 
i do n't know where phil got his info , but look at the ball website . this is not a pressure canner . no meats , no veggies , no soup . 
yes . 
i have used quart jars many times in the canner and have never had this problem . i use only ball or kerr jars . if you are trying to use mayonnaise jars or some other kind of jar other than those specifically used to can , that may be the problem . i use the canner to heat the jars and also to can them in it . i 've just made several juices in quart jars , canned pickled asparagus in quarts , etc . have you been paying attention to when the book says to use the `` grid '' in the bottom and not use the grid ? in the heating and canning process ? it can also be caused by the jar being too cold when the hot stuff is put in it . or , it can be cold stuff being put into a hot jar . keep in mind that everything has to be either hot when it is being canned in the canner . 
it does not save time but it is much simpler and uses far less water . the typical time for jams is 30 min . it also does not heat up the kitchen as the water bath method . if you pair this device with the auto jam jelly maker , everything can now be done on the counter rather than the stove . 
i am not really sure what you are asking . i successfully made blueberry and peach pie filling and canned it . if you use a thickener you will need to get some clear gel a. i had to go to nichols seed and garden in albany oregon to buy some or could have ordered it on the internet . i would suggest contacting your county extension service . i 've canned several kinds of juice that i then made into sauces and toppings . as long as the fruit is acid enough it should be safe to can . what types of sauce do you mean ? 
there is a 12-minute preheat function where you must put the empty jars in first , that is the sterilization step , you do not put in lids or rims by the way , just the open jars . so easy . i just used the canner today making cranberry syrup . i used the jam setting # 1. i love this appliance . no heavy , dangerous pots of hot water to deal with , especially in 90 degree temps like today . 
yes , i have made them using another book 's recipe . i make all kinds of recipes from other books in fact . i use the canner more broadly than just using the recipe book that comes with it . 
it is just the carrying case you must supply your own knives 
it has a built-in brief case designed for your knifes . great for going to work school catering . you can put your lap top books or uniform in it it 's . great 
it holds 8 to 10 knives . 
yea it will 
18 inches long 11.5 inches wide and 2 inches thick 
yes . i attached a headboard and footboard for my daughters bed 
yes 
not this one . this extends length not width 
i believe so , as long as there are holes drilled in the rails of the bed frame that match up ; otherwise you will need to drill holes in the rails . our bed frame had the headboard plates all ready attached , but not for the foot board . 
they extend far enough to be able to attach a footboard . i had a great bedframe , however it did n't allow me to attach a footboard . this adapted it perfectly ! 
i would n't . it may turn with `` just a touch '' , if your touch is heavy . but it does n't glide , and if you find yourself forcing it , the bottles may tip . 
i could n't give you an exact weight that the lazy susan can hold , but i do have them filled to capacity with a mix of glass and plastic spice containers and it turns smoothly . 
the lazy susan is 6 inches high , after assembled . the distance between the shelves is 4 and 3 4 inches . you would love the lazy susan . it looks so nice in my cabinet and makes much more room . 
yes , that 's what i have 
it has different size fittings on it to be able to fit different size mixers . 
yes it does . 
yes . it fits both models by just turning it around . there are different size clips on the back and the front . 
yes 
hi jessica . this is a great idea but , unfortunately , the cabinet doors do not have to be very thick for the door not to close . i think ours are about three-quarters to an inch wide . my daughter still uses it but it makes me crazy that the door does n't close . 
the actual inside of the largest ring is 2 7 8 inches . xxoo 
not firm at all , i had a water bed , which the bed is a lot firmer than and warmer . but not waking up with lower back problems . it 's definitely not a firm mattress , i can not sleep on a firm mattress . to me , its closer to a pillow top and with the 2 '' highloft gel matress topper ordered from overstock . it sleeps well ! 
if you mean piping no not at all 
i do n't and it 's very comfortable . 
that is precisely what they ment they just have no clue how to word it . just head to toe and vice versa . 
what exactly is a gas out odor ? 
absolutely you can . this is a very comfortable chair . 
linda , maybe not . the depth of the seat ( edge of seat to back ) is roughly 22 '' . i 'm 5'8 '' and the seat fits me perfectly ( legs bent at knee and feet on the floor and with my back firmly against the back rest ) . find a chair to set in it and measure the back rest to where your knees bend . if it 's less than about 22 '' , you may have some discomfort setting in this chair in a non-reclined position ( as you have probably have found in setting in a lot of seats ) . hope this helps . don 
it would be a tight fit , and it is also on the narrow side in the hip area , as well . 
hello , true ! thank you , joel 
light enough that my daughter and i picked it up and carried it into the house and set it up in my bedroom . ( e.g. , pretty light ) . 
the chair is very small . but it recliners fully at 6 inches from the wall . it is like a wall-hugger . 
you are kidding right ? 
they are made in the usa 
yes . 
good question . i do not know the answer . on the bottom of the box it does say made in china . i kinda feel duped because i the glass is `` embossed '' with the word nantucket glassware co. est 1918. on the other hand , this has been happily used nonstop since it arrived . i did purchase the `` better '' spigot suggested and installed it without even trying the plastic spigot . 
i bought this because we 're making kombucha and needed another large container to keep us from running out ! this is a nice dispenser , though we did change out the plastic for a stainless spigot , ( just our preference ) . it 's taller than our other and thinner and takes up less counter space so we may go back and get another . i recommend this . 
this is it : stainless works stainless steel beverage dispenser replacement spigot ( polishe & # 8203 ; d finish ) it is 13.95 currently . 
sorry i do n't know . i found the replacement spigot by reading the reviews for the jar . hope that helps ! 
this travel pillow is smaller than a standard pillow . the approximate dimensions are 16 '' x 12 '' x 4 '' . 
16 '' x 12 '' 
this does have an optional hanging kit that can be bought separately ; 
the unit is 11 inches wide , 16 inches high , and 3 1 2 inches deep . 
i measured about 6 and 1 2 inches space from shelf to upper shelf . 
yes , it is almost exactly 3 '' wide . i have 3 '' wide jars in mine ! 
yes . just use the butterfly wings or just use what you get just drill hole smaller so the plastic insert is tight .. mine worked great.. 
approximately 8 '' ( 7 7 8 to be exact ) ... 
those jars are 2 '' x 2 '' x 4.5 '' tall . they do not fit as well in the picture as they have it shown . meaning , the jars are too small for the shelf , so they fit very loose and will tip over . what you ca n't see in the picture is how much space is between the wall and the jar . 
try the `` simply organic '' line of spices http : www.amazon.com simply-organic-certified-2-45-ounce-container dp b000ws1khm ref=sr_1_4 ? s=grocery & ie=utf8 & qid=1407029075 & sr=1-4 
wall mount only . the back support extends below the bottom shelf . 
the bottles certainly have no problem fitting . the shelves are roomy . however , the mccormick bottles tend to tip forward or backward because of the way the bottoms of the shelves are constructed . each shelf consists of several metal rods running the width of the unit and resting on the outer frame . wider-bottomed bottles have no problem , but the mccormick bottles have very narrow bottoms that wobble a little on the rods . personally , i do n't mind . i 've got a zillion bottles of spices and these shelves are an economical solution for storage . 
its just a waterproof topper . only protects mattress from any liquid stains and sleeps very cool with zero detection . 
i put mine in the dryer ( washed before putting on the bed ) and did n't have any problems with it . i made sure that it was on low heat and was only in there for about 25 minutes . it did n't need more time than that . 
so far i have had no issues with either the queen nor king mattress that i put them on . 
yes it is made in china . but it is n't a pad , it is a waterproof protector . 
yes , we do offer a full size mattress protector , but we are temporarily out of stock . we expect to have more inventory next week . 
i dont think that it would work well over a fluffy mattress topper ... the pockets are not very deep and it would shift alot . hope this helps . : ) we just bought a new bed and the mattress is very thick , i am finding that this cover shifts alot and keeps coming up on the ends . 
yes it is exactly like a fitted sheet . 
as stated in the product details : 45.2 x 11.8 x 19.7 inches . i took a tape measure to mine and confirmed . 
small enough that it 's and end table for a midget 
thank you for posting your question . the dimensions of this item are 45.2 x 11.8 x 19.7 inches . this information can be found on the product detail page under the `` product description '' section . hope this helps 
its not a set , its 1 . 
90 mil 
its recycle code is 2 hdpe ( high-density polyethylene ) . hope that helps . 
no lid came with 
12 x 14 id 
no it is not ... it has a steel cap and that holds all the fruits ... 
almost exactly 1ft . tall . 
mine does not 
no , you can not . this particular pitcher is made of soda glass . it 's suitable for cold and room temperature water or juice . it does not accomodate boiling water . refer to grosche website for other pitchers that are made of borosilicate glass that you can pour boiling water into . 
based on the info on their website : http : www.grosche.ca product accessories rio-water-pitcher grosche international is a canadian , family run business . we design and produce high-quality tea , coffee , and beverage related products that are not only functionally superior , but also unique in design . everything we make is bpa and phthalate free , as well as hand blown and assembled for a personal touch . our goal is to ensure that you enjoy your tea and coffee experience by bringing you great products that fit your world . 
no 
no , it is a decent weight ( not too heavy , not too light ) and the circumference of the pitcher is easy to handle 
using it for thick smoothies might create a problem because the lid is made to strain water of fruit solids . if you wanted to use it for most juices , i suspect it would work . i think , though , that you could find better juice pitchers . for fruit-infused water , these are lovely , but they would be better if they held twice as much . 
the comforter was thick but not necessarily soft as it is not made of a knit . we do not use it to sleep with though . we use it for decor purposes and fold it up at night . the appearance is what i was looking for and it definitely met my desired appearance . 
yes , it is machine washable . i do n't have a large washer so i have to take it to a laundromat or use my friend 's front load machine . 
we are currently sold out of the queen size . 
no , only usa 
this was actually a bad choice . the plastic handle melted and i disposed the heater . sorry . 
it burned up before the water got very hot . 
i would not recommend using a foam cup , the boiler could touch the side and cause it to melt or leak . metal or ceramic is most recommended . 
yes , that is why we bought it also . 
the review by a. wiersch indicates that it was measured at 195 watts . 
it easily fits 4 to 5 medium onions and 6 cloves of garlic . it is great and solved my storage problem . the onions and garlic are lasting longer than in a wire basket . 
total height is 10.5 inch and 7 inch dia . separately onion pot is 6 inch h , and garlic pot is 3 3 4 inch . 
white porcelain 
i now use the top for onions too . the few garlic bulbs i had placed in it smelled so strong , i could n't take it ... they are back to the refrigerator . it could hold many cloves ... more than i ever use . i believe it is made in china . 
no . the top is designed to fit into the bottom section , which has a flat bottom . also , the ceramic is quite heavy so you would n't want to reverse them . 
yes 
made in china with high quality white porcelain . 
yes , just put it on the scale and hit the tare button and the scale will zero with the `` weigh-boat '' on it . then you will know the exact weight of what you put in it . very pleased with my scale ! 
yes it will , not very accurately though . but it goes from 0.001g to 20.000g . if you really need to be precise to the mg , i recommend spending more money . 
no it can not . this is a simple digital read out scale . 
yes . it will measure to the hundredths in grains . i just tried it . 
aaa 
the black weighing pad should not be removed . i have n't tried because it would probably ruin the sensor . 
according to my slap-dash measurements , 44 inches . the probe is an additional 6 inches . 
extremely . we have the instant read thermopen ( husbands absolute favorite ) and this . he uses this for oven grill for large pieces of meat . we have actually given these both as gifts . everyone loves them . if you watch any of the grilling shows or check reputable cookbooks , thermoworks is their choice . good luck . 
yes it does 
you can measure for both - but make sure the sensor tip does n't touch metal . 
the chef alarm works great with sauces , just as long as you keep the tip off the bottom of the cooking vessel ( it should be suspended in the middle of the mass ) . also , you should n't be putting electronics in the dish washer ( including the probe ) . ; ) 
hi , this mirror is n't designed to shut off automatically . to turn the mirror off you would use the on off sensor switch that is located on the right side of the mirror towards the bottom . regards , howard - lighted image . 
hi , this mirror is 41.8 watts . thanks , howard - lighted image 
hi , this mirrors and the other mirrors in our range are surface mounted to the wall . thanks , howard - lighted image . 
mine are put away at this time . they are definatley large enough for a can or bottle with a koozie 
we can try to accommodate . but we can not always guarantee it . 
colors are chosen at random based on availability at time of purchase . inventory numbers change constantly . 
hi mary , most nut milk bags listed on amazon are not made domestically . this is a top quality nut milk bag made with sturdy , long lasting nylon that is food grade quality and fda certified . we have been actively searching for a nut milk bag that is domestically made with the same quality as this one but have not yet found one that meets our high standards . our aim is to offer the very best quality products available at a reasonable price . we will update our product listing as soon as we find a suitable nut milk bag that is domestically made . 
if you mean , how much fluid can this bag hold before it overflows , i would guess about four cups . i make six cups of nut milk at a time . i hold this bag over an eight-cup measuring cup and pour until the bag starts to clog , then i keep pouring and squeeze gently to filter the rest of the nut milk . 
~no , only almonds for almond milk . 
yes . our deluxe nut milk bag comes with a lifetime money back satisfaction guarantee . 
yes 
sorry but no , the lowest weight it can measure is 1gram . 
mininum weight 0.2 ounces maximum weight 11 pounds 
i just checked and it 's about 8.3in x 5.9in 
china ( answered elsewhere within this group of questions ) 
i do n't believe that this scale is the right tool for that purpose . is surface area is not large enough for measuring puppies . 
i have used my scale almost every day since it was delivered in september and have yet to replace the batteries . i imagine it is all down to time and usage , plus the auto-off after one minute of being idle certainly helps conserve battery power . 
there is no reference to changing shut-off time in the owner 's manuel . 
i checked the 1-p. user manual that comes with the scale , and it says `` battery : 2xcr2032 , '' which i assume means it takes two cr 2032 batteries . they 're cheap and you can get them at amazon ; i checked , and found 'em at this url : 
no only accurate to one gram . sounds like you need a triple beam or a very expensive digital . 
yes it is . 
china ... ... ... ... ... .and the quality is not very good 
absolutely ; put them in microwave often . 
they have n't yet , and all the plates and bowls have been through the dishwasher numerous times . i 'm reasonably careful , but i have n't been able to avoid banging edges occasionally , since often i 'm all thumbs , and not a chip yet . 
no 
7 + 3 4 inches across and holds 2.5 cups of water 
indeed they do ! 
they are labeled dishwasher and microwave safe as far as being oven safe goes i 'm not sure . 
the salad plate has a diameter of 8 1 4 '' across . 
china . 
yes , the pressed lettering can be seen inside , just backwards with a line at appropriate level . 
they are 18 8 stainless . 
no , they stay upright . 
no 
no . our only concern about the handles is that they are quite short . other than that , they are fine . 
i 'm sure it 's a blend because it does n't wrinkle much when it 's washed and dried . we launder them often here at the inn . stains cone out easily and they are not fading . just which they were a bit bigger . that 's my only drawback . good , lightweight coverlet . 
king size 
it feels like a cotton blend . washes beautifully . we use them at our inn and wash dry them often . no fading . we use the king on the queen though . would love to find calif king in same bedspread . 
my whole family has sat on them . 45-210lbs . 
this is prinarlly used for compacting the coffee foe espresso.. fill the adapter w coffee , compact with the large dia.. keep doing again sfter some more coffee powder.. then compact with the smaller end so that the surface of coffee is below the compactor rim.. load the adpater in the coffee machine tight.. you will get a good espresso at the end.. good luck 
i think it is . it 's washed daily and has n't tarnished or chipped . still looks like it did from day 1 . 
do n't know . i have a delonghi machine . the diameter is 49mm on end and 52mm the other side . 
not sure if its plated ... feels like tin . has n't tarnished at all 
not sure . it 's light , might be cast aluminum . it 's very shiny , solid and works great though , i love it . have n't put it through the washer , no need because it does n't get very messy , plus if it is aluminum , it might lose it 's shine . 
we do not carry water goblets . 
yes 
yes i do 
not sure . i had a nutone system and bought the newest nutone head only and had to return it , because the head did n't fit the wand . i could n't find any knowledge base to know what works with what . so i just kept buying things and returning them until i got something that fit . 
i just replaced existing head that was the same type , so am usure why type of hose i already had . sorry . 
i 'm not sure of what you mean exactly as there 's no traditional power cord on this . on the neck of the device are the power prongs ( two round gold pins ) that snap into my existing long vacuum neck that has the power cord running up it . 
i purchased it for my ct600 & it 's a perfect replacement . 
i sent it back it would n't even cover the bed , very thin material i would n't recommend it . 
this is a quilted bedspread with two matching shams . it could be used as a quilt , although i do not . i found the spread to be shorter than the drop shown in the picture and combined it with a bedskirt . it 's too long to be classified as a coverlet and too short to be a hit-the-floor bedspread . it lacks about 4-5 '' all around to hit the floor . hope my answer helps . 
the nozels are all different . if i remembered correctly , amazon had a few suggestions after i placed the torch in my basket . i went for the same brand so there wo n't be any mistakes . better safe than sorry and it also had great reviews . 
sorry , they are suitable for the iwatani torch . it is a push and twist to hook it up . 
well , it works with my iwatani torch . not sure if you have same model ... if there 's more than one . 
yes 
i am well please this works very well 
no 
chef master butane fuel for use in portable gas stoves 
i think you can use bu6 . i do n't recall just which one i used to use , but mine is an old cassette-feu and it uses the bu6 just fine . great for our bananas foster ! 
just sits on top but it 's a pretty snug fit . it wo n't eadily move or anything 
yes 
yes . i just tested my doterra and edens garden oils and they fit . 
i do apologize , but we do not have any information on the muji drawers . but if you look on the description of our product you can see the size of the drawers . best regards , nile corp 
i tried a color club nail polish and it did n't fit . hope that helps 
hi j. oden , thank you for your interest in the portable humidifier . regarding essential oils , our portable humidifier works best with only water-soluble essential oil . essential oil which is not water-soluble may cause our portable humidifier to experience issues , or even be damaged . if there 's anything else we can do for you , please do n't hesitate to contact us . we look forward to your feedback ! best regards , nancy deneve - co-founder 
about 8 hours , maybe longer . the key is to have a wide , tall glass of water . 
its not rechargeable . it runs about 12 hours before it dies . very poor electronics and prone to rapid corrosion . 
no , i do n't think so . the product packaging says `` always use clean water . do not use any other type of liquid or aromatic oil '' . 
if you place it in a sturdy cup you should be able to , but i 'm not sure if the mist would get to bed height from the floor . 
compared to other vacuums i 've owned , the dyson works well on stairs . the base is small enough to sit on a step , while the flexible hose and scaled-down attachments are easy to maneuver over individual steps and into corners . i have n't had a single problem with this vac . 
measured out to 24 feet . 
i 've owned 5-10 vacuums over the years . this is by far the noisiest . when i vacuum my half bath and want to vacuum behind the door ( which entails closing the door ) , i brace myself for the deafening sound , then quickly finish to get the door back open . i also make sure i turn the vacuum on after i unclick it from upright position ( and opposite when turning it off ) - the decibel level coming out of the top of the tube seems borderline dangerous to me . 
never , they are permanent filters . there are two filters and i recommend washing them once a month . one filter is located in the ball assembly . the other filter is located where the handle to the dirt container is . 
the only change to this vacuum is the name , the msrp ( now $ 399 , was $ 499 ) , and possibly the color of the canister . the specs are exactly the same . this is not a redesign , only a name change . 
nancy , it does , but it is very small ! also , a detail hose attachment is included ! i would check , amazon to see if dyson has additional attachment ! one other , thing , nancy , the dc40 is the original size vacuum ! it is small , does a fantastic job ! if you have animals , you will need to buy the dc65 animal ! it is bigger , but it is heavier ! my dc40 is light , moves very fast , so easy to use ! the larger dc65 , does cost more too ! hope this helps you , nancy ! like i said at first , the attachment is small , about 3 to 4 inches across , with red , fibric pads on either side ! 
it weights 14.6 pounds . the average vacuum weighs 18-22 pounds 
it does very well with small rugs -- does not eat them -- dr 
possibly with super glue 
i do not know as our mattress covers that part now . i can say my husband is 6ft 4 in and weighs 296 lbs , he has no problems with this at all . we are very satisfied .

yes , if you want to transport your machine it is a must ! so easy and keeps it clean . also protects the machine ! 
this model has a metal shaver for the ice . 
& # 304 ; recommend you to use syrups of monin for margarita . 
yes it works very well with frozen fruit i make at least 3-4 frozen fruit smoothies a week.. love this machine ! 
anita , it is a bit under 2 inches ( 5cm ) in diameter . thanks for your question . don ( schefs ) 
no ! 
yes it is good quality . too much sedimate for me . 
no bags ... you use loose tea 
looks like the ball part could be . and the handle maybe not . there 's really no way i would know for sure . i 've long thrown the packaging away . 
not sure , i would think it depends on how fine . i use green gunpowder style but that is a course leaf tea . 
i have found that anything that you buy in a frozen state ( french fries , battered fish , etc . ) tastes amazing when cooked in the air fryer . if you make things fresh , add a little oil to the bottom and you 'll never know you did n't cook it in oil . i love mine . i use it all the time - not like those other appliances that you get talked into that sit in the garage ! !

hi - it is a little difficult . we need to run the pop under some hot water for a few seconds or so in order to pull the pop out of the silicone mold . very young children would need help - maybe 0-6 yrs . just for the fact that you need a little strength to pull off the mold . 
we have the fish mold and use smoothies all the time and they come out yummy every time ! ! ! we use yogurt with it too & # 128522 ;

it 's easiest to put the filling inside before opening the bag since it expands once it opens . 
black felt and the hinges inside are covered with felt also so you ca n't see them . my daughter just loves it to store her school books and computer in . college books are so big but this is perfect size for that . 
thank you for your inquiry . this item is only available in the dark brown pictured . 
the bench has a matte finish . there is a sheen but not glossy like patent leather . 
some of the reviews mention some big people using it as a bench . seems decently sturdy but i would n't use it as a trampoline . we 've had maybe total 250 worth of people on it with no issues . i 'm sure it would take more . 
china 
13inches 
as long as the blankets are not real thick . maybe 3 pillows and 2 blankets . nice for the $ $ . 
no , is not required any assembly . 
mine did not have a skirt attached . it had a great elastic border that fit over my oversized mattress 
i have not had to clean it yet . the sheet goes on top of it , so while i wash the sheets i have not washed this mattress cover . 
no , i can not smell anything at all . the fluffy stuff on the top is actually quite nice , sort of extra cushioney . my only complaint is that the instructions say not to run the electric cords under the mattress . so , i had to shove them under the bed . turns out not to be a big problem . so far , i have used the heated mattress pad for about 2 weeks and like it find . 
1 1 4 inches 
product dimensions:12.4 inches x 11.6 inches x 8.5 inches ; 5.4 pounds 
probably china at that price . 
it seems solid and basic to me . it toasts bread and bagels . my wife and i like it . 
no , a blue light does go on however and goes off when the toast is done . you do hear easily hear the toast pop up also . 
basic `` type a '' american plug..you know 2 flat prongs , with one prong slightly wider than the other . 
the stand can support the tv on its own . it does not need to be attached to a wall . however , current tv 's are tall , thin , and potentially unstable . if the tv is sitting on the shelving , it might be prudent to use a wire cable to attach it to the vertical pole or wall to keep it from getting knocked over . 
22 '' 
about 32-33 inches . 
i did not give that answer , i have a 40 '' tv mounted on the bracket and it is 13 1 2 inches from the top of the top shelf to the bottom of the tv . 
yes it swivels 
i have n't ever had this issue with mine . are you sure they 're coming from the bowls ? do you use them in a mixer ? 
yes ! they work perfectly ! 
i really had n't considered using them for oven so unfortunately i ca n't answer your question . i 've only used them ( and many times in a short time ! ) for refrigerated items ( salads etc ) but i really love them ! 
not really . it feels soft like corduroy , but it does n't have ridges . it makes the `` shadow `` like microfiber when you run your palm across it . my puppy slobbers on it and my neighbor drops his cigarette ash on it and it comes clean very easily with just a baby wipe . 
yes , it comes in 2 cover options . tomato and brown sugar are the fabric selections . 
you could still easily sit a box spring on this , although , depending on the thickness of your mattress and box spring , your bed might be too high off the ground . 
you can use the 2 halves independently , but they wo n't be the same width as a twin . they will be 30 '' wide . 
i do n't think so do n't see any place to attach it sorry 
i have found no noise or squeaking in the one i purchased . the person who sleeps on it does n't move around a lot . hope this helps 
the spa sensation sold by wal-mart states it has a 1200lb weight limit on full and 2400lb on queen , king and california king . it is a similar product . i cant guarantee that this is accurate , but based on the construction of the frame it is very sturdy . 
it holds up great and i washed it in cold water ! 
i 'm sorry i can not answer the question since i gave it as a gift and the girl using it places it on top of the bed ( without a comforter or quilt inside ) so as not to get too hot . good luck . 
coral . peachy coral . 
too small 
white . very very white . scary in a kids room , but we have n't had a problem keeping them clean and looking good . 
no - it has button closures at and but no way to secure te comforter inside . with thay said it is my daughters favorite and hasnt been a problem . 
looking at the front of the unit , it 's on the left side . 
it comes with a little insulation foam . not sure if you can call them weather stripping per say 
6.2 amps 
the unit has accordion pieces that seal against the window frame . they can expand out for a much wider window , or compress to 23 '' . 
if the unit has been tipped sideways during transit or installation , it is good practice to let it sit in the correct horizontal position for several hours to allow the refrigerant to settle . 
not great but not the worst i 've experienced either . as some others have said it seems to gurgle loudly at first and then settles down . but it 's definitely not quiet even after it gets done with the gurgling . 
use it straight out of the box . put the bowl on , if using it , and turn on . when 0 is displayed , add your food . if you are n't using bowl , remove it , then turn on . 0 will appear ... then weigh your food . 
no it does not . but the weight constantly changes if the bowl is empty or not . you just have to take the bowl off and it resets itself . once i had an empty bowl on it and it said it was -37 pounds . another time it said 2 spoons of sugar were 200 grams . after removing the bowl it showed a different weight . i actually never got a correct weight from this scale at all . 
truthfully i have n't the slightest idea . 
i do n't think that 's necessary . the scale allows you to set to `` zero '' so the weight of the bowl is negated . when i tested the scale for my review , i used prepackaged items in my kitchen and allowed for slight variance and i found the scale to be within reasonable tolerances . unless you 're using it for another purpose than portion control or measuring in the kitchen i think you 'll be fine . 
i do believe it has a one-year warranty . 
i have n't had a problem with it shutting off before i am finished weighing my food . i usually wind up shutting it off manually , so i do not have the answer for you . i have another brand at my other residence which always shuts off in the middle of my weighing my food , this one does not do that . 
approximately 18 '' x 14 '' x 5.5 '' 
yes , it is hard plastic . i have been using mine for about a year and it is holding up like a true champ . for the price it was a winning purchase . mine still looks just like new . hope my comments helped . margaret 
no it works percetly for my needs . 
yes it can . easy cleaning once rack is removed from the pan . 
no to small 
it working great and a perfect fit for my blender 
there is no imprint on the blades . the metal base is imprinted with `` rubber ring side `` in english and spanish . 
i have no idea but if its the basic model and looks like it why not take a shot ... you can always send it back if it does n't . 
it fit my oster . do n't know about the 10-speed blender service # 6630 
if they are the same size as a standard blender i do n't see why not but i do n't have those to test . 
there is not enough information in your question . you need to provide a model number . and you can usually ask the company directly , although sometimes they jump on here and answer ! good luck ! 
laura , if your original blade assembly base plate diameter is 2-1 2 '' , this will fit 
i ca n't say for certain , but i do n't believe it is . it does n't have the oster label anywhere on it . but it is exactly the same size and shape as the one i had and works perfectly with my blender . i have had no complaints with it at all . 
yes 
no . it specifies 120v 60 hz . it might work with an adaptor ( 220v to 120v ) ? but this is just a guess , so be aware ! 
just with hot water . take out the little thing and immediate clean it after using it . no problem . 
all you do is pour the milk in and push the button . it heats and froths at the same time , leaving a layer of foam on the top . it shuts off automatically . i usually push the button three times because i like my milk fairly hot ! 
the product is directly from the manufacturer in india ! 
can you please let me know you mattress size , we can send you 15 '' deep pocket fitted sheet , and also can customize it upto 30 '' deep pocket if you want , and yes the mattress we provide can fit calking bed with 3 '' mattress topper . but please advise total deapth of deep pocket , and you can go ahead with confidence , thank you 
my experience using both systems is that the toddy makes a more concentrated , stronger brew . the takeya is pretty strong especially if you let it go a full 24 hours or longer , but the toddy is still a bolder brew . hope this helps ... 
i would n't worry too much since this system makes fairly weak concentrate . just follow the instructions . 
plastic 
the one time i made hot coffee with the concentrate i poured water from my kettle into the cup which had the concentrate in it . i mainly use the the tekaya to brew thai iced tea . 
you do n't use boiling water in a cold brew , i full the basket about 3 4 then full with cold water and let it sit in the refrigerator over night 
no i have only tried other brand which is easy to use and tastes good . 
i left my edible image in a cool , dry place away from sunlight & heat for a couple of weeks and it was totally fine . if you ordered now , it will probably be 8-9 days before delivery ( esp w christmas later this week ) , so it would only be a couple of weeks until your daughter 's bday . 
yes i can print your photo on any of our sizes . here is a link to my storefront . http : www.amazon.com create-custom-edible-cupcake-topper dp b00bqrwm34 ref=sr_1_1 ? m=a128hnjp60vh8a & s=merchant-items & ie=utf8 & qid=1424393344 & sr=1-1 & keywords=create+your+own thanks , eric 
yes our images are kosher and i can add any text you 'd like to the image . thanks , eric edible art 
yes , it 's in its own separate sealed package outside of the shipping package . 
yes 
this has edges , so rather like a rounded square . not circular like a standard skillet . 
yes , xtrema products are made in china . however , they are designed in the usa and the facility in china does everything by hand in a 3-week small batch process . 
just a follow up : there is a way to make it compatible . however , you would need a special induction disk that fits on top of the induction burner . 
with the twin option you are getting only one mattress . if you order the twin full option you are getting one twin and one full mattress . we offer a price break on the combo bed orders because we can ship them together in the same box . 
sorry , i had it for a month and trashed the box . i think it 's 12 '' x 12 '' x 40 '' and about 30 lbs . 
75 x 37 x 7. the twin twin is two twin sized mattresses . 
yes 
the quilting is only on onevery side . 
the price is for three seats with two consoles . the upholstery is black bonded leather . these are manual recline chairs ( as compared to power recline ) . there are two consoles that each have two cupholders . the dimensions are : seat size : 19 '' w x 21 '' d , back size : 22 '' w x 28 '' h , seat height : 18 '' h , arm height from floor : 25 '' h , arm height from seat : 7 '' h , overall width : 95 '' w , overall depth : 38 - 68 '' d , overall height : 43.5 '' h , weight capacity : 250 lbs . the price includes curbside delivery . please let us know if you have any other questions . 
this is not a wall hugger . i have this away from the wall about 1 1 2 feet to 2 feet away from the wall to allow for full recline while watching movies . 
i believe china 
it 's 17 long 9 inches wide and about 8 inches deep plenty of room for remotes 
hi , no . they are all attached in one piece as you see in the picture . 
amazon should have answered this . they sell a set of four extra stoppers for $ 9.99 . 
pull the know in and out to suck the air out . you will feel the resistance when all the air is out of the bottle . 
no . it is plastic with silver color coating . very light weight . i did n't expect much for a device at this low price but it actually works quite well . 
i dont know , but i have not been impressed with this wine stopper -- it does not work as advertised . 
absolutely . 
it 's very loud and you have you manually turn off the unit for it to stop . i find that it is a very good item 
it is plastic 
i 'm sorry but i have not used the measuring cup for that reason . i plan to try the cup again , because if you do n't use something , it is just hit and miss . i really like the egg cooker , it is less messy and i love the poached egg unit ! 
i like my eggs cooked hard , and i do n't think this could be accomplished with adding extras . the machine is meant to soft poach eggs ... they come out soft and with a goopey middle ... not sure an omelet type could be cooked right . 
no 
yes , 
send us your order number , name and age of your child . thank you . 
hi , 50 red and 50 chocolate pics . the ribbon is also included . 
they are laser cut . 
hello ! the size is around in 5cm*5cm*5.3cm 
sorry , this order will be finished by amazon and they will ship one package in 100 pics . so the 50 pics are unavailable . 
no , but it does exactly as it was advertised . my eggs always come out perfect . if i want it soft , then i measure the water to the `` soft '' line in the provided cup . if i want it hard , i measure to the highest level in the cup . this cooker never fail 
yes ; this little egg maker does an awesome job at making hard boiled eggs that are so easy to peel it makes you want to make deviled eggs every day . : ) 
i would guess between 7 and 13 minutes ... it 's really easy when the water is gone the unit turns off automatically and the eggs are done its best to rinse them with ice water as close to when light goes of makes them super easy to peel . i love this gadget we use it often in fact just used it last night . 
yes it does . the bottom of the water cup has a needle like attachment . 
the one i have is 110v . do n't know if they have a 220v . 
yes 
it has something to do with hydraluxe gel technology which is a special gel that is layered into the pillow . sellers indicate that `` independent testing show the gel layer to be 15 degrees cooler to touch and stays cooler up to six times longer than traditional memory foam . '' none of the selling sites that i checked gave specifics as to what the components ingredients are in the special cooling gel . however , my grandson sleeps very hot and assured me that the pillow really works . 
i actually have two items on it . a cotton protector with side zip and a silk pillowcase . it still works like a charm ! 
you 're not going to clean the entire pillow . you just want to spot clean it . again , it does n't harbor bacteria and mold like normal pillows do , so do n't worry that it 's got germs , you know , if you 're a bit of a hypochondriac , the best thing to have is memory foam . just sprinkle baking soda on it , grab your vacuum . vacuum the baking soda off . now , if you need to spot clean it , just have a cup of mild dish soap and water and use paper towels . just use a clean rag and wipe the pillow down with the soap and water mix . then use paper towels , but just press it on there . the water will really be down in the foam . so you want to keep a towel on top of it and just let it sit over night . let it get completely dry before you put a pillow case back on it . 
i have n't noticed any ; my sheets leave more crease marks on my arms than this pillow leaves on my face . the bubbles really are n't that noticeable through the pillowcase . 
dont buy from amazon its bad quality not same as sold in market buy it from market is beter 
sorry i do n't know the density and the manufactor normally does not specify on pillows . i can attest that it is low density as i my head sinks into the pillow . my spouses pillow was $ 130 and has higher density . higher density equals higher price . 
yes . it will disappear after a time , however . 
about 15 minutes but then i move my head to the other part of the pillow where it 's cool and a a few minutes later move back and it 's cool again . it is cool but never cold . 
no . 
i have to use a water bottle and had to learn by trial and error ( took less than a week ) how much i needed by the size of the coffee mug i was using . 
as far as i know all of them . it does not really specify . i just use my own coffee in the little brew filter . works the same without the cost of the k-cups 
i 'd say no . with the bottom base removed , it is 8 inches ( maybe a bit shy of 8 inches ) from base to the bottom of the filter cup . it would be a very tight fit if you were able to get it under there . 
i do n't use a travel mug but it will fit a 32 oz . quart jar which i tried for measurement purposes . however it only handles 1 cup of water per shot so it would tak about 4 cups to fill . 
about 14 oz 
no , simply for brewing . 
yes the rack does come with all of the spices as well as free refils for them for five years from the purchase date 
about 4 '' h x 1 1 2 '' w 
it 's in a plastic bag , it looks like a card . 
i order my spices online from penzeys spices 
i ca n't answer this for ya i got it for a gift for my dad but it 's a good size ! 
everything except for pepper 
yes that are 
11 '' tall , 6 '' wide , 3 '' deep 
either but i 'm sure it 's designed to be the bottom . i could n't get it to stick to my cabinet door . 
11 '' h x 5 1 2 '' w x 3 '' d 
hi gabriela , unfortunately we do not offer shipping to mexico city at this time . 
no you do not have to remove the seeds ! 
it 's not easy to answer this in definite terms like what is a lot or how wet it is , i hope my own opinion on the subject is helpful . i feel the waste is relatively dry , which to me means it is extracting as much liquid juice as it is capable from squeezing from the fruit vegetable . i find the drier waste easier to clean up . as far as how much that depends so much on what is being `` juiced '' but when i look at what 's left it seems to be about what i would expect considering the process it uses to extract the juice , in other words what is left is truly waste and not unprocessed juice , so i would call that relatively low waste . 
i do n't think so , this is for extracting juice from fruits and vegetables , you might want a mini-blender or regular blender for that . 
yes , depends on what kind of deserts you want to make 
i had a similar problem when i bought mine - my experience with my new purchase has been terrific - after pricing other toppers i figured that even if it had n't worked , i would be out less money - very pleased with mine , my back is very thankful ! 
yes . 
full size- these fit well 
it is true to size . fit my mattress perfectly with a little extra 
well , measuring it would be like measuring a cloud . it is about an inch or so , perhaps a bit more . but it compresses , of course . we are happy with it in our rv . does as we needed . 
the probability is that it will . because of the thickness it provides a pillowy feel . 
it is around 6 cups . 7 '' across and 3 3 4 '' deep . its very nice you will love it . 
i would think so because it 's placed over boiling water so can withstand a great deal of heat , but not absolutely certain . i melted white `` almond bark '' and put in crushed peppermint sticks ... but did n't keep it on burner to melt the peppermint sticks and still it was hot enough many of the smaller bits melted . 
yes , it is - i have only used it once so far , and it worked really great . i warmed up refried beans , and they turned out great ... ..usually i burn them . 
i 've used it with both my 3 qt . and 4 qt . saucepans but it does n't fit either really well but i think that 's because my saucepans flute out at the top . i usually use it with my 4 qt . more often and let steam escape out the other side while one side fits snugly . 
i do not think so . i tried it on a regular spring coil mattress and it behaved like a gel eye mask . it stayed cool for approximately an hour and it was very pleasant during that time , but eventually it started accumulating heat and radiating it back . by the way , my condolences on owning a memory foam bed - those things are impossible to sleep on because of overheating . nothing beats regular mattress . i only tried this cooling pad because my bedroom gets hot during summer , but it turned out my bed actually felt cooler without cooling pads on it .

pot holders for the handles are needed , yes ; maybe moreso for gas flame than electric but better to be safe than sorry 
about 1 2 of that at the most . 
no this is not for induction cooking 
yes 
yes 
it 's an 8 '' lid . 
fit all . they are same . 
china . 
the description says usa 
i use canola as a pam substitute all the time ! works great and without all the chemicals . 
probably unless whatever you are using to infuse clogs up the tube . 
sorry david , i do n't the exact weight capacity . how ever , with have had no problem with it so far . all i can say is that it can hold at least 200 pounds with out a problem . hope this helps , best of luck , cameron . 
yes , i believe so 
yes , we did . 
i sleep comfortably with two adults . i 'm 150. he 's 180 
made in china 
i have used it successfully many times up to 450 degrees . 
definitely yes . it would work perfectly . 
no ! 
it slices very thin -is perfect for making crisps . it will slice soft fruit and veg beautifully as the blade is very sharp . 
it 's not adjustable for thick and thin slices , but in my opinion , as it is really more convenient to use than the more complicated and more expensive adjustable mandolines , as there 's no setup and easy to clean . so it 's great for those quick jobs making homemade potato etc . 
after using this mandolin on cucumbers and onions , i think you would get a really thin ribbon of zucchini . i believe it would cut the zucchini just fine , but it would n't be very thick . 
it should work fine with hard raw veggies , but because they will need a little extra pressure , you will want to place the mandoline on top of a bowl so both ends have some support . the mandoline is very thin and bends easily . 
that is correct . it only slices in paper-thin slices . 
hello npat , free ebooks will be send to you next day after the date shipped . hope this help : - ) 
depends on what you put as the sliding handle 
i do n't know because i returned this . it was flimsy and dangerous to use , and had a single stationary blade that sliced paper-thin . 
yes it does , of course depending on what milk product you use , you can use whole milk and cream , or just whole milk or 2 % milk depending on your preference . 
i do n't see why not . maybe preheat the mason jar with some hot water first . 
yes , the max time is 24 hours . 
i assume you are talking about the heating of the milk before you pour it into the yogurt maker . ( the yogurt maker is necessary to keep the milk at a warm temp for 8 hours while the yogurt starter multiplies . ) i started out by using a candy thermometer to bring the milk to the required temperature , and it was n't reliable . now i do it `` by sight '' and it works perfectly every time : i stir over medium heat until just before boiling . the milk starts to get little bubbles on the surface . if it breaks into a boil , no harm is done , just remove from heat immediately . the milk is not that fussy . i set a timer to the approximate time it will take - makes me watch carefully at the end . do not underheat - that will be a disaster and the milk will run through the sieve . 
diane , i 've used two kinds . one is yogumed . i bought it here in amazon . it was ok. the other one was natural yogurt from a little shop ( not supermarket ) . i liked better the second one , the first was to chalky 
that 's how you adjust the adjustable seat . 
yes . we love these . they will last a long time . 
yes , when lowering . great product 
do n't know exactly teresa but they are extremely well made and solid , my husband is 265 and he sits on one all the time to play guitar . we have 3 on our porch and love them ! 
yes , the seat moves independently of the base . this is how you can raise and lower the seat . it swivels high enough that you can sit at a kitchen counter and low enough to fit under most tables to keep it out of sight until you need it . although it 's so cool that you might not want to keep it out of sight , even if you 're not using it . 
beings it is still winter here -- mine is still in the box . gave it to my husband for his work bench in the garage 
it 's adjustable -- from bar height to table height . 
yes you can in the mesh area but i dont . there is also recessed areas above the mesh small items , like a shelf area . hope that helps . all my studs are my expensive pieces , that 's why i do n't use it for my studs . 
33 inches in height , 20 inches in width and 3-1 2 inches in depth . my daughter loves it ! ! 
i hung mine on a flat wall and it works great ! ! ! 
at the highest point at the top of the pillow it is 4 inches . in the curved area it is 3.5 inches . when i press into the center of the pillow to simulate the weight of a head it flattens down to about an inch . 
hi ! using a pillowcase is completely up to you . it would not interfere with the memory foam or the pillow design . thank you , thehomeliquidator 
i just use a normal queen sized pillow case . the pillow case molds to the pillow and has worked great . 
i bought a protective case that zipped . i use standard size pillow cases . they work great . 
the pillow is heavy , probably two to three times that of a regular pillow . it has the feeling of a limp wet towel , presumably because it responds to the physical pressures . do n't try adjusting the position while you are half asleep , the sensation is like dragging a reluctant kitten . it also is not particularly useful to prop a couple of pillows for reading . this is definitely a sleep pillow . hope this helps . 
look on ebay . there 's better prices there too . 
hi i would think they are oven proof glass . they do have plastic lids which would not be . i love them . the are heavy glass , easy to clean and very microwavable . i tossed all my other storage and this set is all i need . 
if you look at other options for the same line , you 'll see that the lids are bpa free . glasslock products are all bpa free . 
i do n't know 
i had 12 plates in mine and they did fine . 
the napkin holders dimensions are : 6 1 4 x 6 1 4 with a depth of 3 1 4 '' deep . 
it can take the small size napkins and not the larger dinner plate napkins - unless you tri-fold them 
no . it all came in one piece . there are some screws under the utencil cups , but do n't know if you can take it apart . 
i never counted , but it held enough for 25 people at our cookout and was n't full 
i had a 9 1 4 inch square plate that fit fine . i also put a sheet of 11 '' x 8.5 '' sheet of paper in the area , and that fit , so if that styrofoam plate is the size of a sheet of paper , they should fit . there is a circle that normal round plates sit in , but i do not think that will cause a problem , just that with a hard jolt , someone could knock the plates off center . 
the cady holds 9 inch plates 
yes you can and that is what i did , i unscrewed the top and slid it into the middle careful w the screws , they are small and i lost one lol 
this product is fulfilled by amazon , and apo uses usps rates apply , so this should not be a problem . 
there 's no reference to being organic on any website that i checked . they are dyed however as stated . i personally recommend the 900 gram egyptian cotton towels . expensive but they last ... and are incredibly soft and absorbent . i warm them briefly in my large microwave for 30-45 seconds . hope this helps a bit . 
i always put a small amount of bleach in with the towels and sheets regardless of their color . it kills germs from the body . 
the bath towels are 27 '' x54 '' , the hand towels are 16 '' x30 '' , and the wash cloths are 13 '' x13 '' . the white bath sheets are 30 '' x60 '' 
27 '' x54 '' 
yes . no problem . lots of good spices ! for the price you ca n't go wrong . 
yep , comes with a code inside the box for you to register for spices , but you do have to pay shipping . 
rosemary , seasoning salt , herbes de provence , crushed mint , oregano , chopped bay leaves , dill weed , basil , parsley , italian seasonings , marjoram , pizza seasoning , celery salt . sorry , do not recall the 14th . 
they are about half the size of the ones you see in the stores 
i 'm not sure but when k got mine it came with a slip that i had to sign up for and i get free refills for 5 years ! 
china 
i can only say i store my scale on its side and it seems to be working fine 
yes . 
no 
this is a scale ... no timer . 
i believe so . . . the numbers are black , about 3 4 '' tall with a blue back light . 
yes 
the scale definitely has decimal points to one place . so , you can weigh something at 7.6 ounces for example . it would not round up to 8 , in this example . 
@ 20 '' 
that is correct , this seat adjusts 22-31 inches off the ground . 
the surface material is bonded leather . 
no , you can not put under the broiler . in fact , you should n't use in an oven above 400 degrees . another tip ... do n't use pam or other sprays . 
china i believe 
the larger one is about the size of a standard cookie sheet , i do n't know what size your microwave is but it could easily be cut 
thanks for the tip denise . the baking mat sizes are in the main bullet points at the top of the page , and the product description section further down . we are glad that people still take the time to ask if they can not find the information they need , and are only too happy to help . 
hi midge , happy to help . there are 2 x baking mats in the set . the larger of the 2 is the half-sheet size ( 16.5 '' x 11 5 8 '' ) , the smaller one is 11.5 '' x 8.5 '' . i hope this helps ! any more questions feel free to ask . 
the silicone baking mats ( x 2 ) * 1 x large half sheet size : 16.5 '' x 11 5 8 '' * 1 x smaller size : 11.5 '' x 8.5 '' 
hi there , the size of the mats are : * 1 x large half sheet size : 16.5 '' x 11 5 8 '' * 1 x smaller quarter sheet size : 11.5 '' x 8.5 '' this information is included in the product description section of the page . hope this helps ! 
hi ahmed , yes this set is perfect for those types of recipes . the silicone mats are heat resistant and non stick so your caramels and toffe will lift right off them . the spatulas are also non stick and heat resistant so perfect for working with these types of foods . i hope this answer helps ! regards , matt - starpack team 
i use it to make a single cup a day . 
sure , but a bit tall . i 've washed it on the bottom rack several times and it appears 100 % fine . it 's double walled , but all stainless , so the minor air pressure compared to the strong cold steel is to little if any effect . go for it on the bottom rack . 
made in china . 
i could n't say . for the one i received there was nothing on the packaging , in the packaging or on the press itself that said where it was made . 
dear ladym we do n't have the certificate to prove it is bpa free thank you for your question home value 
yes if you put something on it , hit the tare button , weigh something else , and then remove it all . like if you put a plate on it , zeroed it out and then weighed some food . when you remove the food and plate , it would show a negative . 
the plastic bowl is dishwasher safe 
0.1 oz or 2gram depending on mode . the scale also adds adjusts for the 4.4 oz . bowl , if you choose to use it . 
5 inches 
yes it will 
no , only kg and grams . ( or pounds and ounces , depending on which mode you choose ) 
hi diane , thank you for your query . no , the adhesive will not damage your tiles and can be removed using warm water and a scraper . also it will not damage marble tiles . elevease comes with simple instructions and once followed will not in any way damage your shower environment . kind regards dave 
i stuck it to ceramic tile . so i really ca n't answer your question . 
i think it would end up being pretty ugly because the adhesive would be left behind . i do n't know how much you could scrap off with a putty knife . 
elevease is designed to fit into the corner of a shower unit to enable the adhesive to stick on to the shower walls . unless you have these angles i would not recommend elevease to you . regards dave 
hi , thank you for your enquiry . when elevease is positioned at knee height as per the instructions , your body weight automatically transfers to your other leg . this means that elevease becomes a foot rest . heavy amounts of weight on the product is not recommended . use in this manner and elevease will not move . regards dave 
i do not know about either of these as i do not have acrylic and have not removed . the adhesive is separate and i would image that if you were concerned you could probably find a known safe bet at home depot . also , the adhesive does not smell like it would be the type that would eat into acrylic . the step is very good , however . 
the outside dimensions at the top from lip to lip is 13.5 ' long & 11 '' wide . 
regarding microban , the dish information did not disclose having been treated . however this appears to be a `` no name '' product being peddled by another party . i am very pleased with it . 
i 'd say a little wider than a twin bed , with the exception of a shorter length ( head to toe ) . does that make sense ? also , it 's alright to sleep on , except that there is a bar in the middle that can be uncomfortable . when you first get it , it 's a little stiff , but after breaking it in , it 's decently comfortable to sit on . 
it 's about a short twin size 
not sure about that but when my sons sleeps on it a twin fitted sheet fits great 
not really that cushiony but very sturdy . ok for someone under 100 pounds 
yes . the `` mattress '' is built into the frame -- the whole thing is an integrated unit . 
hi matthew , happy to help . this unit covers approximately 4000 sq ft. of space depending on the existing air quality of the space . i hope this helps and please let us know if we can possibly help with anything else : ) . 
hi robert , glad to help : ) . all ozone generators require an ozone plate or cartridge in order to work . ozone ( activated oxygen , o3 ) is created when voltage is applied to the ozone plate cartridge to create a corona discharge . this corona discharge reacts with the oxygen present in the ozone generator chamber to create ozone . i hope this helps and please let us know if we can help with anything else : ) . 
waite at least one hour . i this on a 45 foot motor yacht to kill mold and odor . 
glad to assist : ) . as a safety pre-caution , this ozone generator does not have a continuous run feature . this is because very highly concentrated levels of ozone can be a respiratory irritant , so more ozone is not always necessarily better . however , ozone does dissipate quickly and converts back to oxygen and this unit does have a timer function with a max 2 hour run time that is more than sufficient for most odor removal applications . the timer can be reset immediately after it ends , in the event that a 2nd purification treatment is needed . i hope this helps and please let us know if there are any additional questions we can help answer : ) . thanks ! 
hi j , the ozone plate cartidge is made of ceramic . yes , this ozone generator will kill airborne mold spores and eliminate odor for a period of time . however , no ozone generator on the market ( no matter what a manufacturer will tell you ) will eliminate all mold spores in a contaminated area . this is because mold spores can hide in nooks and crannies in interior surfaces such as inside drywall and other porous material like clothing etc . that may not necessarily be reached by ozone purification . generally , ozone purification treatment is used after conventional mold clean-ups that involve a bleach scrubbing of contaminated surfaces . i hope this helps and please let us know if we can help with anything else : ) . 
hmmmm ... .let me measure . i have them on a hospital bed with a gel mattress , . i think they would comfortably fit a 12 '' mattress . hope that helps . 
60 % cotton 40 % polyester 
these sheets are 200 thread count . 
not even a little ! ( being the scientist that i am i had to test ... put just water in , laid it on it 's side then upside down . no leakage . 
you do n't need to stand them up . the seal is very good . i put them on their side in the freezer and they were fine . 
manufactured in china 
no . i have been using them for several months and have not noticed any smell . 
yes , the filter pushes air through a charcoal pre filter & gt ; a hepa filter & gt ; uv light . all of which are replaceable . it 's recommended to replace the pre charcoal and hepa filter every 6 months or so depending on use and how contaminated the air is . it 's also recommended to take a vacuum to the filter every month to pull out the larger particles that may be lodged in it and extend filter life . when i looked for replacements they were not available on amazon , but easily purchased through the manufacturer 's website . 
it has n't changed much , it 's a bit loud , i keep it on low unless i 'm not there then put on higher ... 
no 
i just measured mine : 11 inches high 7.5 inches deep 6.5 inches wide 
the cadr is 64 . 
no it is metal and it never had a odor that i ever noticed . 
yes , as long as you do n't expect it to blow your hair back . it is also pretty quiet . 
yes you can . the cover unzips easily and folds back 
two and half to three inches 
yes 
the cover was not sold separately 
horizontal x 2. holds 10 full or we do 14 half = 7 shelves . and 3 full = 3 shelves . 7+3= 10 total shelves . saves so much space . also we can proof and store with this . 
hi ... my charge lasts for several days and that is after using this little appliance in my 4,000 sq ft home ... it is great thus far ... but i have only had it for about two weeks ... i highly recommend this product . it is great ... especially on hard wood surfaces ... great picking up pet hair ... i love it thus far ! ! ! ! ! i think that one should use it until the charge expires ... then recharge it ... do n't keep it charging all of the time ... charge it ... use it until it expires ... then recharge it . do not keep it plugged in ... 
yes . it works great on wood , tile , and carpet . 
v2700g works very well 
i do n't know as all i have are laminated floors , tile and carpet . i have had no trouble on the laminated . 
yes the charger is included i do n't know the v 's but it charges completely from nearly dead in about 4 hours . 
i leave mine in for about 24 hours . a friend who has a day care and uses it everyday leaves it plugged in all the time . 
it comes with a ni-mh battery . everything you need is with it . you have to put the sweeper handle together and click it on the sweeper itself then plug the sweeper in with enclosed charger for 7 hours to initial use . just follow all the directions as best as possible and the battery should last for years . my older one of 8 years still has the original battery . hope this helps . 
i know shark does sell them but it would have to be charged . best check with them . 
yes it is 
16 ounce capacity 
i ca n't tell you exactly , but it fits in my cup holder in the car . i hope that helps . 
unfortunately no , it 's not . 
i never tried just brewed hot tea , but i did put warm tea in my cup and it was fine . 
yes . they 're great hangers , and i use them for jeans as well as tons of other clothes . 
a big yes to ur question i hate that as much as i hate ironing . they hang my garment surprisingly well , especially satin tops the velvet material on the hangers creates a buffer . 
yes , but if you rotate it too much , it will come loose . 
i have not had a single hanger break and i have been using them for months . i have not used them , however , to hang winter coats or the like . i use heavy duty wooden hangers for that . 
a little short of a quarter inch , a little more than 1 8 '' 
it swivels 
yes they will . they are very nice hangers , built well and take up minimal amount of space in the closet . and garments do not slip off from the velvet coating . 
i find that pants do not crease on the felt hangers like others ... .i also hang long maxi dresses over them in half so the dress length does not stretch out as they are heavier on the hanger than most dresses . i have had great results . another great bonus i have found is the greater amount of space i have in my closet , the hangers are slim and sturdy ! 
product dimensions : 17.5 x 0.2 x 9.5 inches ; 2.4 ounces 
8 oz . perfect for a nice cup of tea : ) 
no , it does not ... i love these dishes ! ! 
i would use the word as off white and near to cream . but not very creamy in colour . 
yes 
they are a bit heavy but i enjoy using daily as they are so classy looking that i dont feel the difference . 
9 7 8 '' x 9 7 8 '' 
i do n't know measurements , patricia , but they are ample ... i already had little square bowls like this set.. a knock off of some sort , but they are too small for cereal , etc . the bowls that come with this set are perfect . i love this set ... they 're great ! dawn : - ) 
it 's made in china . for the price it looks great and upscale . it also holds up well in the dishwasher . 
it 's about 8 '' tall with cup and attachments . but more to what `` i think your asking is '' , the interior mixing part holds 1 1 4 c of liquid . so base what it will hold and grind off that . it works very well i try to grind all of my spices prior to using them . i like this little sucker and would purchase another if need be . 
on the bottom it says made in china . 
will grind 3 4 of a cup no problem . 
yes . super powerful . 
no , you vary the time you to change the grind . the longer it is on the finer it gets . 
when i grind pepper corns , i strive for `` cracked pepper '' , but i always get a bit of `` fine ground '' even though i check the results after each pulse . that 's to be expected with a blade type processor . i 'm happy with the resulting `` mix '' . 
my husband and i have sat on this bench at the same time , our weight combined is about 300 lbs , and there was no sign that the bench could n't support our weight ... so at least 300 . 
it does n't have the slat board in the back but it is finished and looks fine to be seen . 
itbisvabout 4 inches deep 
i do n't think it would stand up to dampness . 
there is a parts list that shows where every piece goes . just look at it carefully and you will see that this picture parts list is the directions . very easy . 
no , i measured it and there is a little less than 8 inches clearance between the bottom shelf and the bottom of the seat . 
it is stamped , made in china.it works fine so far . 
no . 
it does n't hold a lot , but i never found one on line or in a department store that did . i have never measured , but i would say less than half a cup or so . wish i could be more specific . however , it is so easy to take apart that how often i need to refill it is really not an issue . i am happy with this grinder and highly recommend it . 
not a lot -- maybe 1 2 oz ( 1 oz , max ) or about 1 3 cup . here 's a secret to all electric pepper grinders : use small peppercorns . big peppercorns will clog most of them , this one included . i love this item ; i have one for salt and one for pepper . 
this looks like the pot i purchased . yes it works on an induction stove . that is the type of stove i have . 
7.5 '' 
i use it on an induction cooktop . might not be the best stand alone pans . but for usage as a double boiler it 's fine . 
2 but they are all polyester not cotton . this was disappointing as it said cotton on front but labels said made in china polyester 
they are made of 109 % egyptian cotton . i have never had such soft , beautiful colors sheets ! you ca n't believe how soft they are even when you feel them . i will try to buy only these brand sheets from now on . 
i do n't se why you could n't . they seem to be pretty sturdy . the top is like a non skid type of material . 
12 3 4in . x 12 3 4in . x 3in . 
there are 6 separated rows . 
the instructions say to clean the filters every 3 months and replace the hepa filter every 18 months 
the biogs spa-550a uses 5 to 29 watts ( energy star ) and the voltage is 120v . 
hello , c.j.e ! with average indoor air quality and 24 hour daily use , the filters in the biogs 2.0 will last for 18 months . if you have any other questions please feel free to let us know ! regards , the rabbit air team 
the drawer can open either right side or left side depending on how you put it together . 
the dimensions are 11 3 4 '' w x 8 '' d x 23 '' h with 9 1 2 '' w x 7 '' d x 1 3 4 '' h drawer . 
only needs a half inch to slide under edge of couch . 
i 'd say no more than 35 to 45 lbs ! 
8 '' x 12 '' x 23 '' h 
that is n't listed among the ones this is for , so i would guess not . but i do n't know for sure . 
it fits on ours & works very well 
yes 
i do n't know . it would n't work in my 530. had to ship back and get a refund . it was n't compatable 
there 's really no reason it should n't be . 
yes 
i have model 572. i do not know if it will fit model 520 . 
i ca n't find any reference to a model 589. are you sure it 's not a 585 ? anyway , my roomba user manual is for the entire 500 series , so i am sure the battery is common across all 500 series models and the battery you are considering will fit yours . by the way , it 's been a great battery at 1 3 the cost of the roomba battery . 
i used the first one of these for 2 years and have just recently replaced it with another , it lasted as long as the original battery , with about the same run time 
this item comes with 2 pillow cases 
i 'm not sure . i still have not received it . i think it is being shipped from overseas . no tracking is available and the first shipment got lost in the mail . i am actually still waiting for the replacement shipment . 
fits a double 
i have not cut them up - but i have looked this up on line & with the silpat company & they said no . do not cut as the fiberglass mesh particles might migrate into the food . 
no . company in wisconsin but product made in china . 
it is loud . very loud . but it works very well . and it 's only on for a short while , so just put up with the noise . 
i 'm sorry to say -- that it does not turn off . to me , that is a problem that eureka needs to address . if it would be a feature that will create a problem , just lay the unit down to raise the brushes . 
yes 
eureka airspeed rewind pet ( model # : as1041a ) and airspeed unlimited pet ( model # : as3033a ) both have cord rewind . thank you . 
it says 10 amps . 60 hz . i have a small place and it 's good . the suction is good and also do n't have a lot of carpet . if you have a house with carpet all over i would n't recommend it 's light weight which is good but i think it could be a little better quality . i like it for what i need but i am glad i do n't have a lot of carpet to vacuum . maybe it 's just me because i am use to a dyson or heavier vacuum that i just might not be use to a lightweight vacuum . 
i do n't find it especially loud . not exactly quiet either but much quieter than my oreck upright . 
i do n't know the horsepower but if it helps any i put it by the curb yesterday ( it 's my scheduled day for trash pickup ) . '- ) 
( please note i originally answered `` usa '' because everything i could find on the web seemed to indicate as such . ) until i found the following buried in the product specifications at e-store.allclad.com : 'non-stick interior dishwasher safe 16 '' x 13 '' made in china ' . sigh . that 'll teach me to open my mouth before i finish my research . 
kent gave one pro of hard anodizing = non stick surface in an earlier response . a con would be that most hard anodizing is done on aluminum . essentially hard anodizing builds up an extra thick and stable coating of the base metal 's oxide form . so in this case its aluminum oxide . some people have bad reactions to aluminum so they would want to avoid hard anodized aluminum pans . stainless steel is on the other hand an alloy of iron , carbon and chromium . there seem to be less toxicity problems with stainless steel than with aluminum . stainless steel will wear harder and longer than an anodized pan but it will scratch and it has almost zero non stick properties . 
i would recommend against broiling in this pan . the handles are relatively high and are likely to come in contact with the heating element . also , the sides of the pan are at least two inches high and the meat sits low in the pan . thus the sides will interfere with the airflow and effectively you will end up roasting , not broiling . 
yes . it 's heavy duty and i would be comfortable browning meat on the cook top before putting it in the oven . 
i 'll let you know after thanksgiving . i 'm planning on a 20 lb turkey , so i 'm hoping it will hold at least that ! 
yes , it 's a solid material throughout and there is no teflon or coating on the roaster.it holds the heat really well so be careful not to burn . 
all clad non stick coating applied to interior . has a lifetime warrenty from all clad 
yes about 6-8 hours it stays really hot warm starts to cool down after that . i have had a hot green tea in the bottle and i drank it after 6 hours and it was perfect ! ! ! 
yes . i have 3. you can put all liquids 
yes , it 's spill proof 
yes , only cold drinks . technically , it will keep drinks warm hot but it 's not recommended to drink out of straw ... could get burnt . 
yup 
almost 7 inches tall . 
no , 1 only 
the legs of this frame are square . if the bed risers allow for square legs , then the risers could be used . 
i do n't believe so . there were only two attachments which are for the headboard . 
i am not sure of dimensions of an extra long twin , but this frame measures 66 '' x 55 '' . my double bed is 3 '' longer but it 's ok . 
not sure i can provide a precise answer , but the boxes are pretty enormous . with a little ingenuity , i 'd wager you could fit at least a dozen , and possibly up to 20 , adult-sized sweaters in one of the boxes . 
they are if they are all the way filled . if not , and they have a decent amount if weight in them the tops sink im 
no , there was really no smell at all . 
yasmine i do n't know that was a couple of months ago i purchased the chairs ... sorry . 
i do not know 
can handle over 260 pounds . 
no , dry clean only 
it is an amazon technical issue . we contacted amazon but it can not be fixed soon . currently we are enabling the promotion offline . any customer who buys the all season comforter for more than $ 300 or $ 400 value will get this promotion and we will ship the free item to our customer directly . 
it 's a board notched at the top so the headboard slides over it and `` hangs '' on it . the board is first mounted to the surface of the wall with screws into the vertical studs behind the drywall . be sure to check for level and mount it at the proper height . this is not difficult . after assembling the head board 2 people will be required ( one on each end ) to pick it up and slide it down and against the wall so the hanger on the back of the headboard catches the groove on the horizontal rail mounted on the wall . important not to over tighten the screws causing the groove to be squeezed and reduced in size causing the headboard not to fit the groove . again not difficult . i am very pleased with this head board and bed as it gives the room a very `` clean '' look . 
i purchased the leggett & platt fashion bed group murray platform bed sold on amazon . it is very sturdy , and it looks great with the headboard . 
yes - the bed does n't attach to the headboard at all - we have a moveable base and no issues 
hi jack - i actually never opened it , and was unable to ship it back , any chance you are in the ny area , you can have mine at a reduced cost . 
106 lbs 
r. luo the entire unit is held up by a long bracket piece that 's fastened to the wall studs . you then mount the center headboard piece in the middle and after you 've completed the nightstand assembly they mount on the sides of the long bracket piece . i have a high bed so i placed the top of the nightstand 35 '' inches from the floor . i completed one nightstand and measured the bracket insert location on the wall relative to the 35 '' inches i wanted the nightstand to sit , marked to spot and anchored the long bracket piece . 
hi ronnie , the queen headboard is 107.2 inches long . best regards , netrush 
the overall outside dimensions of the bottom container are 5 1 2 '' x 4 3 4 '' x2 1 2 '' ( with the lid on ) . the inside dimensions of the bottom container are 4 3 4 '' x4 '' x2 '' . 
we use a `` retro style '' pottery barn lunch box and these boxes and ice block fit perfectly into it . as an addition to the rubbermaid boxes and our favorite lunch pail , i also swear by the eco vessel brand drink thermoses . they have a flip top that my daughter can easily open and close by herself ! it took me a few purchases and some frustration before i found this perfect trio for my full-day kindergartener to have a successful lunch . i hope this response helps with your purchase decision . 
yes 
yes 
it is it 's own separate piece , you could put it on the bottom if you would like to . we use it in a small child 's lunchbox and it keeps the whole thing cold no matter the placement . hope that helps . 
yes they can . the containers have 'imprints ' so that they fit together whether you use the ice pack or not . 
no , rubbermaid packs as a set 
i have been using this for at least 2-3 years , it has never dulled . when using these , you must be very careful ! they are very sharp . if you use it for vegetables that are too small for the holder , be very careful . 
yes it has 4 inner metal pins . 
around 3 '' or 3 1 2 inches 
yes , it has a blade that can make fries . 
yes , 3 different levels of thickness as thin as 1 8 in . 
there are no instructions for reordering blades in the manual but the website provides an 800 number for questions or requests regarding replacement parts . 
hi karen ! there are three slice thicknesses : 1 16 '' , 1 8 '' , and 1 4 '' . there is also a julienne blade . janet 
made in china 
yes , you can adjust time for any cooking , like stew , poultry , vegi ... i love mine very much , save me a lot of time . 
the book lacks in forthcoming information . i was not looking for it but do not remember seeing yogurt listed . 
just for vegetables , but not for meat . 
i would start by going to the company 's website 
teflon 
i have not actually timed it but i would guestimate about 10 minutes + - 
yes it does . i cook everything in it . it 's an amazing pressure cooker 
this is a great cooker it has good safety features but is good for a large family , and a large kitchen counter space . 
no , but they are pretty sharp for table knives . 
no 
the only imprint says gorham or gorham 18 20 . 
yes 
there are 12 teaspoons and 12 soup spoons , plus my set also included a couple of serving spoons . 
yes it is . 
i have as of yet not received this . sorry i can not answer your question . 
yes 
dear ms heckrotte : thank you for your email . please note item # 96351 , `` floral bouquet shower curtain '' is made of polyester and is machine washable . a liner is optional . if you have any further questions , please feel free to contact us again . thank you for contacting collections etc . on amazon ! 
i have this in my shower and it is not sheer , but not completely opaque . ( if i put my hand behind it , i can see my hand , but it is n't see through either . ) i am using a liner and am pleased with it . 
the background is a pale gold 
dear mr bradford : thank you for your email . please note we do not carry the item you are seeking at this time . we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause . thank you for contacting collections etc . on amazon ! 
you definitely should n't use it . the donabe is popular because the ceramic is porous - it likes to absorb water . in the microwave , water can evaporate very quickly and damage the ceramic , causing it to crack . you should also make sure the bottom is dry before using a stove . http : toirokitchen.com all_about_donabe how-to-take-care-of-your-donabe 
no need to season 
yes you can use this in the oven 
yes it is safe 
one 
yes $ 3.99 each.. 
yes it does . air conditioners work by transferring the heat in the air into the refrigerant contained in the unit 's coils , thus cooling the air . in order to keep cooling , that heat has to be exhausted to the outside air . 
have n't had it very long but it is not supposed to need to have the water tray emptied , unless humidity is exceptionally high . 
wattage 1,080 , voltage 115 , amps 9.6a . i use this portable unit to cool my art studio which is a 10 ' x 10 ' straight-sided tent erected inside our covered screened back porch , making my work space usable all year round even in brutal texas summers . it works for me ! 
get at least 20 ft. it is much harder to set up than it tells you . at least the wheels will have some moving around room if you want to move the a c to a different spot . i did n't even know about the 20 ft. lengths or i would not have sent mine back . it cools great . but the exhaust is powerful and hot . the 20 ft. sections do not come with the unit . just in case you did n't know . hope it helps . 
yes i have it on a full double bed . 
yes ! beautiful and great quality ! 
no its not a nice dark hot pink ! but it still looks good , i had a hard time finding hot pink for my daughter but she loved that this had the zebra and cheetah so this is what we went with ! 
sorry , no . the capsules for the machine are specific and coded . nothing else will work . 
yes it came with a sampler of pods . 
the $ 100 credit is available to anyone who purchases a nespresso machine $ 199 and above between 11 28 14 - 1 31 2015. see the terms and conditions here : https : www.nespresso.com mobile us en news yep % 202014 % 20vl ... i ordered my nespresso from amazon and received my $ 100 credit by completing this voucher : https : www.nespresso.com promotion us en yeppromo14 : ) 
not for virtuline as the capsules are bar-coded for each different type of coffee and espresso . 
no , i had to buy the drawer seperate , but it is worth buying it . 
large are enough to make about 4-5 of the coffee sized drinks . 
yes . it comes with a year warranty parts and labor . nespresso gives you a loaner machine while yours is being repaired as well . 
chrome 
yes 
do n't think so looks like brushed metal of some sort 
it is one solid unit . the electrical cord plugs into the side of the unit . you have to plug and unplug the cord with every use ( if you want to rinse after every use ) . it 's a decent quality frother . 
i just went in and measured . at the maximum fill line , it holds just about 1 1 4 cups . 
i am not really sure what you mean by that , andrew . i can tell you it works really well . we love pouring the milk in , turning it on , and by the time our coffee or tea is hot , the milk is ready to go . nice and hot , and if you like it frothy , this product is for you . 
no . warm but not hot . 
yes , approximately two cups . 
it 's pretty floppy , so i have n't tried using it without putting a cookie sheet under it ( i use it all the time ) . you could probably do it without , but i just prefer the extra stability ! 
1 ounce for 24 cup muffin pans 
the lack of sufficient oil may cause this . 
no , its for the 12 cup muffin pan 
standard 
there is no hole on the base , but you can take out the base and bolt the stuffer in the board 
work both ways , just adjust the canister.. thanks 
yes 
yes 
no . i only have what was originally shipped . i would contact the manufacturer directly 
i do n't know about `` scizzers '' , but i believe you could use scissors to cut the material . 
this liner is clear . 
probably not , unless you can adjust the height of the bar that holds the curtain . 
brice - the picture you have here is not the product i purchased . i bought the `` saturday knight -the world peva shower curtain '' which is a special kind of cloth . the world shower curtain needs no liner as it is that cloth kind - it comes with 12 grommets and 12 plastic oval rings for hanging . made in china i was afraid to unwrap it for fear it would smell . no worries - it was installed it and it 's great . it replaced the former `` curtain '' and `` liner '' ! 
rough edge in . 
the height of the arm is 26 inches . note that the arm is slightly higher closer to the back of the chair , where it is 27 inches . the height starts to increase at about 9 inches from the front of the arm , which is about 14 inches from the front of the front legs . 
i returned these . i took one out it was already scratched and scratched at the tiniest use . i have three boys . they 're beautiful but not for everyday use . especially children 
at least 200 pounds for sure . 
no assembly is required . 
yes , there is a recycle logo . i knew that when i bought the chairs and i must say it was the first thing i looked for when i unpacked them . i was relieved that the logo , in my opinion , is not prevalent . it 's not something anyone would notice unless someone pointed it out to them . happy to send you photos . 
not that i know of 
yes they do stack . 
i ca n't claim to know maximum weight but if it 's any help , i had a 220lb guest sit on them without any trouble . 
no , we have it in bathroom , run it 24 7 year round ( freezing winter weather at times ! ! ) another in a bedroom ! ! 
one year 
i do not recall there being a hose option on this small de-humidifier . i found it insufficient so i re-boxed my de-humifier & stored it in my storage locker . 
i would say yes - it does warm up a small bathroom ( but not a large florida room ) ... and i would never leave it unattended . that being said ... does amazing job of dehumidifying these rooms for such a small unit ! 
that is correct and it 's one of the easiest ones to ever have . the basket just pulled out washable and easy accessible.i love it.very easy to use . 
hmmmm ... .that is odd . did you accidentally choose a reduced cup brew ? i think it has that choice i. programming , however , i have never used it . i have never had mine brew only 1 2 a pot either . 
i did a simple search for `` replacement carafe bella orange 13845 '' and the first result took me to http : www.bellahousewares.com beverages coffee-and-tea collections-coffee-makers orange-dots-collection-12-cup-programmable-coffee-maker-13845 where the first question is about an orange replacement carafe and the answer states `` please reach out to our customer service team to find out more about what is available for replacement parts . here is the number 1-866-832-4843 . '' 
we had the same problem . i think it was a sensor . we only had ours 2 weeks or so and returned it for a refund . 
no 
yes i wash mine in the dishwasher every day 
hold down the start button to shut off 
i measure 12 3 8 '' and 10 1 2 '' with the lid inverted . 
calphalon unison pieces are clearly marked toledo , ohio but this specific contemporary one has no markings , so i assume it is not completely made in the usa . it could be because of the different product lines . 
this one is the best is excelent 
this is an aluminum pan . this will not work on induction , sorry . 
no do not use this there . in the fine print , you see it is nsf 42 for water treatment standard . this is the minimum . filters for making truly potable bacteria-free water are nsf 53 ( 53 means they filter bacteria like naegleria , cryptosporidium , and giardia ) . for more info : http : www.nsf.org services by-industry water-wastewater residential-water-treatment residential-drinking-water-treatment-standards 
no it does not . in the fine print , you see it is nsf 42 for water treatment standard . filters for lead-free water are nsf 53. for more info : http : www.nsf.org services by-industry water-wastewater residential-water-treatment residential-drinking-water-treatment-standards

no , it is only for filtering for taste . does not get other contaminants like bacteria , lead , etc . in the fine print , you see it is nsf 42 for water treatment standard . this is the minimum . filters for making truly potable bacteria-free water are nsf 53 ( 53 means they filter bacteria like naegleria , cryptosporidium , and giardia ) . for more info : http : www.nsf.org services by-industry water-wastewater residential-water-treatment residential-drinking-water-treatment-standards 
no you do n't need to shake it every time you use it ! you only shook it the first time to activate the filter thing 
i think so . less waste , less expense . it 's always better to use a refillable water bottle than to buy water already bottled . it 's a huge waste . this filter gives you great.tasting water that 's always available . 
when the filter gets old it will slow down , using a new filter will fix the problem . 
yes , they will work in terms of size of screen . i still want to see if they hold up , without the metal ring center to avoid tearing . 
i do n't know . i bought mine for a french press . 
well , danny , not sure ... .did your 6 cup stainless steel coffee percolator come with a mesh screen to begin with ? ? if so , then it probably will ... .these are nice , as they are tightly woven and actually better than the screen that came with my original coffee french press . hope this helps . lauree 
yes , tried & tested . thanks for your interest ! team idylc homes 
12.5 inches deep x 57 inches wide excluding ends . ( 58 3 16 including side panels ) 
i ca n't advise on 2 studs and 2 anchors . i would be nervous about it . 
9 series more compact and looks thinn4 
the $ 109 version is only 48 '' and not 58 '' . it only has two divided sections instead of three divided sections that come with the 58 '' 
black 
they are 6 7 16 x 1 13 16 x 7 16 inches plus the hook , which is about 2 1 2 inches . you will have to sand them to really release the cedar scent . 
the boards are 10 cm ( height ) by 3 m ( width ) and 1 cm ( depth ) with a hook on top to hang them 
they last at least 4-5 seasons or more for me ; if you place them carefully where the cedar can properly protect clothing , towels , sheets , etc. , you should have no problem with them lasting an extremely long time . as long as you continue to smell the cedar , the protection will always be there . 
david , i am here to tell you they are competely non toxic it is really a good product and is does the job well 
yes 
it has a urethane coating in it . very durable . the kids have used paint & markers & it has all washed off 
they probably would not fit pushed in all the way , and the narrow ends are only a little bit wider than the chairs . so it would be cozy but if you are using it for play meals or short-term use as a kids table at family meals it would probably work okay . you would probably want to get a larger table if you would regularly be using it for 3-4 children doing projects or eating at it . 
i painted mine with geometric patterns to match our grandsons playroom . i did not do anything before i painted . i put on a dealer after i was done to make sure the paint did not get worn off . i have have it this way for over 6 months and no problems so far and it looks great ! ! 
yes - definitely . 
i just measured mine : 20.5 inches from floor to top of table . 
i did n't see it specified anywhere . i sit on them at times without issue though . 
the order comes with 2 racks of 3 rows . each rack is 11 '' wide and 10 '' deep . so both side by side would be 32 '' wide or you can spread them out . hope this helps ! 
top opening is 3 1 8 '' . stem opening is 1 1 8 '' . i am happy with the sturdiness of the unit . make sure you have the correct orientation when you install so that you can slide the base of your stemware onto the racks . 
i would guess a minimum 1 2 inch . 
i do n't have the answer because i had to return this product for that reason . i have a few different styles of riedel vinum stemware and some of them would not fit because the base was too large for this product . 
1 foot 
i really did not pay attention on the package and i do not have the package any more , sorry . 
this should fit over a 1.5 '' door . 
to be honest , i dont know . but remember the whitlpool owns maytag so it might be work . go to the sears parts website and type the serial and model number and look on the diagram for the number which represents the heater core and it will give the part replacement number . then you copy paste the number and paste it on google or bing and it will give website the have the part for sale , look if amazons is there if not copy paste the part number and do the same but on amazons . hope it work for you , thats what i did to find the part ... 
well is under whirpool oem , so i would say it is and it was exactly like the one i removed ... 
no . they are thin and very flimsy though . 
yes they are . i 've put mine in the dishwasher and had no issues . i usually wash them by hand because they 're very easy to clean and i can re-use them sooner . but they can be put in the dishwasher 
1mm 
these do flatten after being rolled ; however , i would suggest placing a heavy flat object over them to speed the process . i rolled mine up and they flattened after about 30-45 min 
no 
i think so . i put them in the dishwasher . 
yes , we have two 8 '' chefs knives and a large sharpening steel in ours with plenty of room . i am really very happy with this item . it has a large capacity and it looks great . 
about 3 inches 
the top 3 slots are 10 '' to 10.5 '' 
12 '' long yes . 
i am not sure , but thr quality is just not there . where the slits are it is very rough . 
no 
i just use a timer , an it 's been working great 
i have a active air and a c.a.p one this is about same as the c.a.p not to loud but active air hydro farm one quietest of ones i bought . as for long term dont know havnt used long . carbon filters do stop filtering after a while so not sure how long filter part will last . 
i contacted the manufacturer in israel and was told there are no instructions available in english . if you received instructions in hebrew you may want to take them to a local synagogue and see if you can have them translated . 
do n't know exactly , but try kosher stores they might have it . good luck 
this comes with just one fine mesh screen . 
only if the cover is closed . otherwise will leak is the kid turns the bottle upside down 
on the ninja turtle thermos the straw is silicone . hope this helps 
i have called thermos and ordered replacement straws a few times . it comes as a set , the inner straw and the piece that fits into the lid . very inexpensive . per the thermos site : `` replacement straws are available by calling thermos at 1-800-831-9242 '' . 
yes 
my daughter is using it to keep warm water . 
because it is a suction cup of straw.easy to scald . 
detailed desc . says 10.25 '' to top of slat . 
no , we do n't use one . i believe it is made to be used without a box spring . the slat supports seem well made , stable , and supportive . 
the bed feels pretty solid . i have a tempurpedic mattress on it and it fits well does n't creak or shake . my partner and i weigh about 300 pounds combined so we are n't particularly putting a lot of strain on it , but i toss around in my sleep and have n't felt unstable nor have i heard any squeaking in the 6 months i 've had it . 
i imagine you can because it will sit on top of planks . functionally it should be fine . i use a mattress only though . you will want to be careful of the total height because it will take away from the look of the headboard . also , you will need to completely cover the box spring because of how it sits inside the frame . a bed skirt will not work with this frame . hope this helps . ryan 
it could absolutely ! however the center legs for the slat supports would need to be cut down or something shorter in their space . since the slats sit a couple inches higher than the frame . 
i have an 18 inch thick mattress and it looks great with this bed . 
the cushion is 18.2 inches wide . i wear a size 18 ( or 1x ) and its perfect for me ( all of me rests on the cushion ) . you might try it and return it if it does n't work for you . i just spent 3 days sitting on a couch without it , and mild sciatica and hemoroids immediately returned . so i know the cushion does help ! 
the handle is sewn on to right side of the cushion if you are sitting down or on the left if you are standing and looking at the chair . 
the coccyx hole cutout is approximately 4 inches wide and 5 inches in length . just the right size . hope this helps . lilly garcia 
no . cloth cover 
no , thr cushion is no waterproof . 
there is not much of a slope . i thought it would be too thick and put me too high to fit under the steering wheel but no , it works perfectly , still have room between top of legs and wheel . i am a plus size and drive a small nisson sentra . try it , if it does n't work , send it back . i am 100 % satisfied . although i just received it i drove over 200 miles this past weekend and no back pain . 
this is taken directly from their website . `` what is bpa and how is progressive handling it ? bisphenol a ( bpa ) is a chemical commonly used to make polycarbonate plastic , a clear , shatter-proof material . progressive makes a conscious effort to avoid these materials when designing and producing our kitchen products . we do however have two items in our line that are made from polycarbonate , our microwave butter melter and drip-less poultry baster . '' 
yes , the ml is listed on all of the spoons except the dash , pinch , and smidgen . 
yes ! all measurements are written on the handle . 
raised measurements - still love these ! 
they are , according to type on box , made in china . they are also dishwasher safe and the handiest measuring set i have ever found . thanks for asking og happy new year ! ! ! 
there is no indication that this is available , and i suspect that 's because it is n't . ma'am , i used to have a mail-order business . if i got the cups for free , it would be a breakeven operation at $ 8 to read your mail , process your payment , ship out the cup you want ; boxes are expensive , and both ups fedex charge an extra $ 2 for residential delivery . and people would ( justifiably ) complain they were being overcharged , and if the color did n't exactly match what they already had . these spoons and cups are *incredibly* cheap and amazon is geared up to handle shipments efficiently ; they 've obviously negotiated deals for packaging and shipping . . if you need to , buy another set , and you can use the spare cups and spoons in with products like brown sugar , loose tea , etc , for convenient use . 
yes

just got it this past christmas and only the rack required assembly . i did not know until i opened box , however i must say putting the rack together was very , very , easy . 
the metal goes the entire width of the table and is anchored at both ends . 
yes . but one of the tables broke right away . the rest are fine . 
i 'm sorry i do not have them in black 
from the floor to table top is approximately 26 '' . 
it 's boards of real wood ( white pine ? ) that have been glued together and shaped and sanded . they are sturdy and look fine for casual use . 
well they fit into a grooved spot and do n't collapse if you move carefully but they do n't really lock . 
i do n't see why it would n't

all dehumidifiers will heat up the air , it 's a fundamental physics bit about how they work . the measurement can be effectively correlated by the efficiency of the unit , and as such this one is pretty good according to consumer reports . i do n't have a second model to compare this to , but can say it 's heating up the air ~15 f roughly . i 'm using it in a 500 sq ft apartment , and if left on all day it will raise the apartment ~5 degrees . it also dropped the humidity of the apartment from 70 % to 35 % overnight , so no complaints . and it 's more quiet than the ac , which i now can use less often . 
i did n't notice the increase 
yes . i have mine sitting close to a drain and use the hose that was included . 
sure does ... . 
i 've only had mine for about six months but i have n't heard of a recall . 
definitely not stainless steel . according to baking steel 's web site the product is made from recycled steel . so it is likely not carbon steel . nevertheless , it works wonderfully if you follow the suggestions . 
i have an aluminum peel with wood handle and use it to slide my pizza or bread dough from peel to steel and visa versa . the baking steel can get some scratches from use but it has no effect on the sheet as it is only cosmetic . 
it does n't come with one . i do n't know if one can be purchased , because i do n't think one is necessary . 
i have cooked chicken on the steele but i did partially bake it on a pan , then finished it on parchment paper on the steele . came out great 
yes . i bought it to use with the nuwave magnetic induction systems . works great with them . good luck . cracks me up that amazon ca n't get the spelling right . i have told them twice before ... lol it 's stonedine not stoneline . 
i am not sure , but it makes the best fried potatoes and cabbage which was a recipe from my grandmother who was from germany . 
yes , ,it is a frying pan , ,can be used on any type of stove 
no 
i love it 
the coating . 
no . it is metal interior and plastic exterior 
each compartment holds about 10 oz each , with some room left for the lid . 
no it does n't : ( 
good 
dontk now never tried 
no it felt much hotter to me 
i bought the twin xl and it fit one side of my serta icomfort adjustable split king perfectly . 
i love mine.yes it 's quiet . 
it 's like a fitted sheet . 
dimensions are listed in the last bullet point on the page , right below the size selection options . the twin xl is 39 '' wide x 80 '' long . other sizes are as follows : twin : 39 '' x 75 '' twin xl : 39 '' x 80 '' full : 54 '' x 75 '' full xl : 54 '' x 80 '' queen : 60 '' x 80 '' king : 78 '' x 80 '' cal king : 72 '' x 84 '' 
i have the app on my phone and it works just fine with the scale . is that what you are asking . i can record my weight on my phone at any time . 
your answer depends on the children , when the bed is down it is as secure as any bed and the hardware is stable and secure . i would not suggest jumping up and down on as children have a tendency to do . i slept in a bunk bed as a child and my parents had strict rules . i 'm very happy with the one i built , follow the instructions and you should have no problems . 
if you make it according to instructions , with a maximum mattress depth of 12 inches , yes it does identify each piece , the materials you may make it from , and the dimensions . the piece of wood that supports the mattress must be plywood . 
when folded down it is 7 '' , if you are talking about the distance between the floor and when it is closed it is 2 1 2 '' . 
the sizes for this topper follow standard bed sizes minus 1 inch on each side of the length and width to ensure your sheets fit over the topper and your mattress . here are the approximate dimensions for each size : twin - 37 '' x 73 '' x 4 '' twin xl - 37 '' x 78 '' x 4 '' full - 52 '' x 73 '' x 4 '' queen- 58 '' x 78 '' x 4 '' king- 74 '' x 78 '' x 4 '' cal king - 70 '' x 82 '' x 4 '' 
i used one on a hide a bed in place of the original mattress . i hope to find a zippered cover but it sleeps very well even with a 300 lb adult . you can not feel the bars under you at all . 
i do n't know the exact detentions but it was pretty small for the king size topper i bought . i would say it was 1 ft wide x 4ft long rectangle . 
it does not have a cover . i bought the 4 inch lucid for a twin size bed and it is 4 inches thick . i guess u can cut it with some big scissors or a sharp blade . hope 
its probably your box spring that is creaky . i do n't think a mattress topper will improve the sound 
no it does not come with a topper . 
i do n't know the exactly weight but it 's pretty sturdy . i 've had it for 3months and that has never been a concern for me . 
19 '' 
had to get it down from the closet ( giving you some information there ) the manufacture is five star pillow in los angeles . 
not sure - i would not purchase this product . it 's extremely lumpy 
i do n't know for sure . 
hi , thanks for your question . this pillow is available from several different marketplace sellers . sellers set their own prices and we do n't have any information about how they set their prices . if you 'd like to contact one of the sellers directly , you can do so by going to their storefront page and clicking on `` contact the seller '' in the bottom right-hand corner . i hope this helps ! 
i do n't know . what i do know is : i really like this pillow . i have bought and returned many others prior to buying this one . if it last at least 2 yes . i will gladly buy another one . hope this helps . 
i do n't know for sure . i believe they are . 
do not know 
ours ended up not being actual memory foam so it was any good . they do make them with memory foam but there hard as a rock . 
yup very well too 
yes it does juice kale ... kale drinks are my absolute favorite ! ! ! 
no , it is a centrifugal juicer , but i love it . i use kale and spinach weekly in this juicer and have had it almost a year 
one finger at 9 o'clock and one at three o'clock and apply a little lift . 
the only difference in the models of botvac ( 70e , 75 , 80 , 85 ) is the supplies ( brushes and filters ) packed in the box . you can always buy the least expensive botvac now , and get the supplies later . compared to the older model xv , the botvac runs a lot longer on one charge , covers a lot more territory , moves faster and more efficiently and is about 10 db quieter . unlike the xv , it navigates my open floor plan without getting stuck in a continuous loop . i have only had the botvac for a week , and use it on a combination of hardwood and carpeting . now that the batteries are fully conditioned , the botvac runs two hours , then it recharges for about an hour , then it runs for one more hour to finish my whole place of 2500 square feet . the old model ran for 45-50 minutes per charge and would never finish my whole place in three runs . i had to have two neato xvs running at the same time to do the job , ( starting from opposite ends of my floorplan ) . so one botvac does the job of two xvs , and does a better job of picking up crumbs as well . 
put it in the trash compactor 
neatorobotics has a one year warranty on the botvac and a 6 month warranty on the battery . 
any of them will work on hard floors -- but one with a combo brush will be much quieter than one with just the blade brush . 
i 've been testing my new botvac80 the past couple days . on the first few cleaning runs the dust bin fills up and i have to take it out and clean it ( very quick and easy ) plus clean the filter and possibly the brush ( takes 5min or less ) should n't be expensive to maintain if the filter lasts several months with regular cleaning , but only time will tell . right now extra filters are not in stock and it might be quite sometime before the price comes down on them too . hopefully the brush and battery will last a long time too and not need expensive replacement , but that too only time will tell . 
yes 
yes . it does an excellent job . the ultima has the vortex blade similar to the vitamix blender . 
i make peanut butter often n love it , and flour do n't know have not try but preaty sure u can , this machine is really good.. 
my ninja is 120 volts only . 
yes the blade detaches completely , super easy to clean .. 
3 
yes it does n't come with an adapter though but it will work 
yes 
the support weight is 300 lbs . 
hi freda , our portable folding guest bed weighs roughly 32 lbs . sincerely , sleep revolution 
not designed for wheels . it is not very heavy and so can be moved around easily . 
our queen bed only has 7 inches clearance and you need about 13 inches . we store ours in a walk-in closet . 
14 '' off the ground . seems a little lower than a regular bed . could be because the mattress is only 4 '' thick . 
100 % polyester filling and cover . 
unfortunately , i did wash it in the washing machine and one of the decorative pillow cases was ruined in the washing machine . the fabric is delicate so i would n't recommend it . 
i maybe wrong , but i do n't think this included sheets set . it is a comforter , bed skirt , four pillow cases three decorative pillows . ( if there was a sheets set , it will be total 13items ? ) 
i just put in my regular washer and it 's always fine 
2 pillow cases , two euro size pillow cases , three small decorative pillows and bed skirt . 
off white 
i have not bought it but the dimensions are under item description . the queen comforter says its 90 x 90 , the bed ruffle is 60 x80 . hope that helps . 
4 to 5 cups depending on what it is that your are putting in there 
yes . it is nice and smooth 
not sure , but the blender i owned was no good . the pitcher leaked and if not put on base properly the gear will grind down . 
plastic however i belive you can buy a glass one 
no , sorry . it is not a good model . 
yes , this is good for making smoothies. , thanks 
yes it does have auto shut off . i love this and use it daily . i put my doterra oil mixed with water and it smells wonderful in my home . 
thanks for your question , this humidifier is not battery operated . the product description states `` power : input output ac100-240v 50~60hz dc24v 650ma '' i hope this helps ! 
no , not at all ... i love mine . it saves so much that can be returned to the earth , i would recommend it to everyone that takes from the earth . 
push it down in the hole towards the top of the lid and then pull it out . to replace it , lay the new one it and slowly work it into the area between the top part of the lid and the middle area . 
not yet , we have had it for 4 months and put it through the dishwasher many times . 
yes ! you need to take out the charcoal filter at the top to replace and that can not be washed but the lid and bin have gone through our washer undamaged several times . 
i think it is one or two gallon , the description says how much it holds . my family four needs to empty it once or twice a week , and it stands about a foot tall . 
one ! 
should be easy to find at bed bath & beyond or similar stores . 
unfortunately no box says made in china . 
sorry ... my folding board does n't indicate where it was made ... 
no , but it clips together quickly . the directions are easy to follow . it took me longer to fold my first shirt than to put this together . 
it 's so tiny that it cools ( or warms ) the person . yes it has a fan only setting . 
the cord is about 6 feet long . 
no it needs to be plugged in to an outlet 
it 's quiet i keep it under my cubical and nobody hears it and we 're pretty close to each other 
wattage on low setting is 750 and the amps usage is 60 
yes , i use mine all the time on my glass top stove with no problems . 
they work really well on mine and i have an induction cooktop . 
i had to research and this is what i found `` says dishwasher safe : no . do n't do that . enamel can etch over time in the strong detergent used in dishwashers . enamel can get an ashy surface as the glass substance can get etched with microscopic scratches and haze ( enamel is , basically , glass fused onto metal . ) '' 
is this still on sale ? 
it was on sale.. it is no longer 
about 2in wide and about 1.5-2in tall . a good size for making candy or cute ice cubes . i 'm using mine for frozen dog treats . 
i use it for making soap so i have no idea how would hope up in the oven . but the butterflies are small like the size of an ice cube so i would n't want to try to grab it out of the oven 
yes it appears to be silicone . 
i 've had these for a couple of years - they are covered in rust 
very easy to put on and take off rod . slide easily . i have both a liner and curtain on each hook . hooks are very easy to work with . 
the ones that i bought were polished chrome . 
i do n't think so . my rod is slightly over 1 in . and that looks to be the ideal size . the actual diameter is 1.5 by getting them on would be difficult and they would n't be able to move freely . 
i think they spin but they ca n't move down , they are stuck together 
they are polished chrome 
no . this is actually the second set i 've owned - the first was lost in my last move . they hold up beautifully . 
304 stainless will not rust . i believe the difference basically is that one is alloyed with nickel the other with chromium.chromium alloys are much whiter . 
yes ! that is the reason i bought this product . i am a very warm sleeper . other waterproof pads had me waking up in pools of my own sweat . this product is n't quite as cool as traditional non-waterproof pads , but it is better than any waterproof pad i tried previously . expect to only have 15-20 % of the sweat caused by most waterproof pads . 
i returned . 
it protects the mattress without generating any heat and it does not draw heat from your body the way other waterproof covers can . 
this is a cover for your mattress so , no it does n't make noise . 
i have a memory foam mattress and it did n't work for me . i do n't need a wetness shield . i needed something to keep me cool . it did n't help . hope this helps 
i emailed fletchers ' mill to ask the same thing before i bought it . here was their answer : our muddlers are untreated unfinished . you could season it with mineral oil from time to time if you want but we do n't do anything to it . it is raw maple that has been kiln dried to prevent cracking or warping . 
absolutely . that 's the reason i purchased it 
the width is approx . 1 3 4 '' 
nothing on the packaging about oven temp . i made muffins and baked at 375 degrees . they worked great . easy to hand wash -- put a drop of dish soap and just rub them between your hands , and rinse . my other silicone stuff goes up to 400 degrees , but i 've never used any of at that high a temp . 
thanks for the question , it made in china ! 
ty , just measured ... bottom is 1 3 4 inches , top is 2 3 4 inches . standard muffin cupcake size ... hope it helps ! 
i have not used mine in a toaster oven but i goggled it and someone had used theirs in the toaster oven with good results . 
if you are going to use them for food ( either baking or food portioning ) , then it would probably be a good idea to wash them first . i bought mine to make soap in , so i just gave them a quick rinse in warm water before using them for the first time . 
to the top , 1.5 oz . 
hi debra , our baking cups is size 7cm on the top , 4.5cm bottom and 3.5cm height ! it consider not the mini size , thanks . 
the bottoms are not seamed , so even though it 's straight across , it does kind of round out when it 's filled with nut milk and pulp . i love mine . 
i personally have n't tried it for making cheese and do n't know what the process involves . i have only used it to make nut milks and have had good results . the mesh appears very strong and able to hold up against a good deal of pressure from squeezing . do n't know if that helps . 
i have only used it for making almond and walnut nut milk . i am sorry i could not be of more help . 
no , the bag is made in china . 
i can not find the box at the moment , but i think it 's china . 
yes 
sort of . they recommend using pans on low to medium heat . if you use them on high heat it will get hotter and be harder to clean the pans . 
yes , everything is stainless steel except the spoon and spatula . 
you get what you see in the picture . 
its pretty good 
its made in china . 
yes this does work with rhe seal a meal . 
yes . 
i do not know never used the deni 
i do not know about a rival seal a meal . i know it works well with the food saver . i use mine all the time . 
yes just unscrew the top 
yes , can make sun tea or use lipton 's cold brew ... would not put extremely hot liquid in it 
steel 
yes , it does 
yes , we do ship internationally . thanks 
yes , we wll refund you 10 $ if you buy 4. btw if you need more i think we should have around 8 or so 
the lid screws on tightly . the lip you drink out of snaps . i carry it around in a bag ... even when its full and it has never spilled . 
we apologize we only ship within usa . thank you . christy isale-usave ( usa ) 
yes , we do ship internationally . you can place the order online . i believe the shipping cost is 19.99 $ . thanks 
yes , if you do not install the desk , the bookcase can be placed at the other end . 
yes they can be switched . just not at the end where the desk is ! 
the assembled bed is 42.5 inches tall by 42 inches wide by 78 inches long . it is big enough to accept a twin size mattress easily . we have a 9 inch deep mattress on it , although not reccommend , as it brings the child up even with the guard rail.my granddaughter is 8 years old and we are not concerned about her rolling off . 
yes , there are two movable parts , the bookshelf and dresser . 
it 's a regular size twin so the bed part would be fine , but the actually loft aspect of it is kind of lost on someone that age . the ladder and accompanying desk and drawers would seem to small for a 10 year old . definitely out of range on a preteen . 
it comes in 4 boxes . 
yes- i received two chairs for the 86.99 price . they are terrific chairs . nice looking and sturdy , easy to store . 
hi mary , underneath the chair it says safe weight limit 250lbs . hope that helps ... .. 
i do n't have the exact dimensions but they are very comfortable and sturdy . i am a large woman and am quite happy with them . i would guesstimate the width across the front at at least 24 '' and the depth at about the same . the seat is not square as it is a but narrower at the back . hope this helps .

18 '' hi . 
there is a release and then the back of the seat lifts up . 
18 '' 
no - simply remove the packing . they are great ! 
at least 225 pounds . no one heavier has day or stood on it since i have had it . 
five boxes total . the main table and legs in the largest box , around 100 lbs , that box easier to handle with two people . the chairs came in four boxes , two chairs per box , each box about 40 lbs and easily handled by one person . 
its made from birch hardwood . 
it has removable leaf , nice table . 
no 
we do n't sell it we just buy a plastic and put it on top as a protecter 
no 
hi mary , each unit will purify 500 - 1,000 sq . ft. of space depending on existing air quality in your space . i hope this helps : ) . 
yes it does , for the smoke smell . obviously if you have something dank lying around you will still be able to smell that . 
very simple . unplug the unit first . 1 ) push the button near the top to access the filter . flip open the top of the unit . 2 ) to remove the filter unit pull up by the handle . 3 ) use a soft cloth , warm water and mild soap . do not submerse the filter in water or rinse directly in water . use the cloth to remove the dirt from the filter then rinse the cloth often to remove the debris and soap . repeat as needed ! 4 ) very important : only touch the filter by the handle and most of all the filter must be 100 % dry before you install it back into the unit . once the filter is dry slide back into the slot gently do not force it ! the filter will only fit one way . 5 ) close the top and snap it shut . plug in the unit and you 're good to go . hope this helps . 
the first couple weeks i kept it on at all times . now i just had it on when we are sleeping or if allergens are high . the air remains fresh in the house . i also do not have to dust as often because it has cut down significantly . 
hi brigitta , yes , the purifier works for pet dander . however , please note that purifiers do not work like vacuum cleaners so it will not remove dander off all surfaces like a vacuum cleaner . purifiers can only filter the air that passes through the unit . i hope this helps : ) . 
i currently have one in my daughter 's room because of her allergies and my family room . both are pretty decent size rooms . 
yes . in my review i said that i removed the dividers & did n't use them so i could fit more cleaning supplies in . also , i did n't use the screws to attach it to the bottom of my kitchen cabinet . i just placed it inside & it works fine . 
it seems to be a standard rolling wheel inside a metal track . very smooth pullout . when the drawer is fully open , it stops and can not be removed unless you tip up the front of the drawer and lift it out of the track . 
yes there are tabs on the back end of each unit to secure it to a cabinet bottom and the screws are included . 
first - single basket - i ordered a few then you can stack them like the third picture . i love them ! 
10.6 inch is the shelf , the basket is 8 inch . 
this is not a true memory foam mattress . it is a foam-like core ( not springs ) , but it does not feel firm and dense like memory foam . this is a soft bed . i would not suggest this mattress for heavier adults or for couples to share . i bought this for my teenage daughter and she has been raving about it 's comfort . i slept on the mattress last night , while she was having a sleepover , to test it out and she 's right . it is incredibly comfortable ; especially for the price ! 
this mattress is sold as a standard twin size 38x74 and a full size 54x74 . the mattress is 7 inches thick . 
i 'm a 240lb adult and this thickness of mattress is comfortable enough that it turned a horrid futon bed into a place where i can actually sleep . 
it 's 12x12x40 in the box 
yes , we live on oahu and received our mattresses in two days . 
we have those wooden slats that are attached with fiber strips . ( they come rolled up - ikea ) a box spring would make it too tall for a bunk bed . several pieces of wood would probably work . for comfort , you do n't need a box mattress . 
in the box i received was a twin size mattress that was compressed foam rolled up like a jelly roll . once i pulled off the compression tape and rolled it out the mattress expanded to a 7 inch depth within 24 hours . mine did not come with any liners or pads , or frame . i hope this answers your question . 
hello , the orange knife is a paring knife and is 3.5 '' & with the blade cover 8 '' ; the yellow knife is a utility knife & is 6.5 '' & with blade cover 11 '' ; the green knife is a santoku knife which is 7 '' & with blade cover 12 '' ; the red knife is a bread knife ( the only knife that cuts my homemade bread without tearing it apart ) is 8 '' & with blade is 12.5 '' ; the blue knife is a slicing knife & is 8 '' and with blade cover 13 '' ; the purple knife is a chef knife & is 8 '' with blade cover 13 '' . i hope this helps . 
i have washed mine several times in the dishwasher . there 's no rust on the exposed metal edges and the paint coating has stayed on the blades just fine . the plastic handles also appear unaffected by the dishwasher . 
no it does not come with a knife block . 
it depends on how strong your magnetic strip is . i bought my strip on ebay . it 's made of oak & has very strong magnets . these knives stick fine with the blade guards on . 
no , there is n't but there should be ! nevertheless , these knives all come with matching sheaths , so they can easily go into a `` knife drawer '' and not cause any cuts to the hands . 
it depends on how strong your magnetic strip is . i bought my strip on ebay . it 's made of oak & has very strong magnets . these knives stick fine with the blade guards on . 
something that zips so can be removed but is somewhat tight so it does n't bunch . i used a thin cotton one i had left over from the last time i purchased a topper . hope this helps : ) 
oh my gosh yes . it 's amazing . like , genuinely amazing . i have one on my bed and one on one of the guest beds and i 've actually packed one with me before when visiting my parents because they have a harder guest bed . 
it adds two inches to the total height of mattress so it depends on the thickness of the underlying mattress . we did n't need to on this topper , however , the mattress at our main bed did require an additional cover , thicker mattress plus topper was three inches . 
yes i think it is ! 
it 's a topper 
just the comforter . i bought the matching sheet set separate . 
yes 
yes it is . 
there is one pillow case for the twin sheet set which comes with one flat and one fitted sheet . good quality as well . 
yes it is ! the other side is girly and pink i actually like the other side better 
looks to be about 1-6 32 '' or exactly 30 mm on the two upper horizontal bars.. 
plastic 
yes , according to this link http : www.appliancepartspros.com search.aspx ? model=rvm1325bw003 your magnetron pn is wb27x10017 . double check your model # though , i think you put an extra 0 in before the 3 at the end . a company that makes a major line of microwave replacement parts cross refrence this pn to 10qbp0229 but you can also use 10qbp0230 without an issue with the inc. stud kit ( 4 screws really ) see http : www.genuineapplianceparts.com item 10qbp0230_erp_microwave_oven_magnetron 756 . magnetron cross reference http : www.mainelectronics.com pdf micropart.pdf currently on amazon the 0230 is the cheaper of the two @ $ 38.37 to your door - http : www.amazon.com gp product b0050kjd4o ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 you can see my review there also . your oe pn for the hv diode should be wb27x1160 . if yours is actually bad and you need one with a little searching you should not have to pay more than $ 10 for one , maybe as little as $ 5 or $ 6 to your door , cross ref . to 11qbp0237 or 11qbp0236 , the only difference is the piece of shrink tube insulation . here is one for $ 3.75 not inc. shipping http : www.appliancezone.com showproduct.aspx ? id=26900 and on amazon currently @ $ 5.46 to your door for the `` generic '' part http : www.amazon.com gp product b004we8rle ref=olp_product_details ? ie=utf8 & me= & seller= or with shrink tubed installed for another $ 4 http : www.amazon.com gp product b0050kjdy4 sr=8-1 qid=1384755580 ref=olp_product_details ? ie=utf8 & me= & qid=1384755580 & seller= & sr=8-1 if you already have shrink tube avail . save yourself a few $ . good luck . 
yes 
so they can return this kit if it turns out to only be a bad diod ? 
youll need to call ge and they will tell you which part number get and fit right . 
there 's no cross reference showing this mag would be compatible , but it is possible it would work as long as the terminals , body and fins line up the same . 
if the microwave now 'runs ' but makes a different sound when you try to use it , the problem is most likely the magnetron . on my ge model , the magnetron burns out about 2-3 times a year . it 's really frustrating , but the cost of a new model like what i have makes it reasonable to just keep replacing the magnetron . i do n't recommend doing this yourself unless the unit is out of warranty and you do not have any kind of service plan . 
yes it will work . according to the ge parts web site your model jeb1095bb002 uses a magnetron part # wb27x10089 . the magnetron part wb27x10017 ( referenced above ) is a replacement for wb27x10089 . i suggest you follow the recommendation to replace the magnetron and the high voltage diode that come with it . 
slide the canister lock to the unlock position and remove the canister by pulling it forward . 
no . but , i love it anyway . 
12 amp , perfect for carpets & hardwood floors . 
i just got it , so i am not sure . maybe bissell can answer that . 
i do n't have hardwoods , either , but you might find it helpful to know that she is no delicate beast . this vacuum is rugged and the brushes are tough . my laminates take a beating if i forget to rotate the switch to the correct flooring level . maybe not so good against the finish on your floors.. ? 
this is a single hose ac unit . 
yes it has a timer . up to 24 hrs timer in one hour increments 
yes , it should . 
it ca n't go in a window , but it needs to be near one to vent the exhaust ( hot air ) . if your table is strong enough , you could put it on a table , but the unit is pretty heavy and possibly bigger than you expect . it would probably look a little odd . 
no , very easy . put the pieces together with the screws included , add the strips of weather foam and shut the window . 
you need access to a window for exhaust and a hose ( or something ) for drainage . 
yoshihiro cutlery 's hammered damascus knives are very easy to take care of . hand washing and drying is recommended as well as using a good quality cutting board . honing on japanese whetstones is also recommended because honing steels can adversely effect the edge of a japanese knife . 
no i havent , i use mine 12 hrs a day , be sure to only use a wetstone to sharpen , and only use ceramic not a metal steele , never cut through bone , it should be fine 
it means there are 2 cutting edges . usually 50 50 meaning equal angle edges . this does n't really mean anything unless if you sharpen your own knife . 
oh my yes . 
this knife allows you to make surgical cuts in just about anything so i would think it would be ideal for sashimi , although i have not used it for that purpose . 
the wood portion of the handle is 4.25 '' . 
it is much more of an all purpose knife . it will work for sushi but you really need a longer blade for proper sushi or shashimi 
it comes with a hard papper box and it 's a really nice knife but you should get the nsw shitan for $ 209 way better 
i would contact yoshihiro and ask a sales rep ? i 'm not sure . 
probably 14 inches 
it has an ordinary 3-prong plug 
seems to be pretty much the same machine . 
plastic 
yes . mine sits on my counter 
4 oz . you can fill with 1 2 cup of unpopped corn . 
yrs , we brought them and they work greate 
yes it will still work but it will not put out as much heat as having all 3 bulbs working . 
each edenpure is different . check to see which one you have before you order . 
the bulbs are 500 watt apiece 1500 watt total . you need 3 bulbs 
these bulbs match perfectly ! 
i dont think a warrenty comes with this bulb kit , but your heater should have come with a pretty good warrenty if you kept your reciept . 
yes there is a warranty on these we just bought some 
i only got two years out of the two top bulbs the bottom bulb is original . 
sorry cindy , i have no idea . i 'm trying to remember how i found out about the kit in the first place ; i spoke with someone on the phone who advised me about it . oh yes , i went directly to edenpure first , then to one of their on-line reps who advised me about the kit . you might try that route . good luck , susan 
4 5 16 '' x 5 3 16 '' x 7 8 '' 
yes . g , oz , ozt , dwt , gn , and ct 
yes it does 
no , it will only read to the nearest 1 grain . 
yes , a stack of nickels works great . 
mine have not ... but i wash them and dry them right away . love them though ... . 
i just washed my by hand . they did n't come with any instructions so not sure . easy to wash by hand though 
you need the lid from the mason jar otherwise the 'hole 's in the lid are open 
i am not sure , i have the 16.5 oz mugs . they are so cute and i was able to put the decorative straws in the middle where the hole is . they are so cute , you may wish to try them , then if wo n't fit send them back . hope this helps & # 128515 ; 
yes 
no actually it 's does n't fit . but paper straw will fit the slim one . 
i received paperwork for the warranty ; everything was included with the name of the company and contact info . 
shipping weight : 50 pounds 
we let it sit for about 6 hours ... there was no mention on the instruction tag of any specific required time frame ; only thing it said was to rotate it every 2 weeks for the first 6 months . 
yes you just need to put a size up from what or is 
i 'm not sure . i just removed part of the bamboo cover and examined my mattress . there is a thin , gauzy , stretchy bag like cover over the entire foam mattress . inside this cover bag , there is 2 inches of blue green gel infused foam and another 9 inches or so of dense foam . everything is then inside the bamboo cover , which has a soft quilted top and sides . to me , this cover bag does not appear to be wool , but it may be . i 've just never encountered wool in this form . 
i no longer have the box , but it was quite long , one person could drag it but you would want a friend to help you lift it into a car . the diameter was about 12 '' x 12 '' and i would harbor a guess at about 7 feet , just like a bed . there was no `` wiggle '' room in the box . 
i would call it firm , but not super firm . i call it just right ! we tried medium and soft and found them to be to soft 
yes it comes with a `` sateen '' cover that zips at the end . make sure you take it off and leave the pillow to air out for at least 24 hours before you try to sleep on it though . 
it has a `` new foam '' smell for a few days , but after that i did n't notice . i do n't think its harmful , it just stinks when straight out of the package . 
the approximate dimensions for the king size are 35 '' x 16 '' x 6.5 '' 
two are the same . no difference . can be used in either hand . 
ours shipped from china . 
no . but because of the peculiarities of my kitchen layout , i have to carry 400 degree pans for a distance of about four feet and these gloves work perfectly . if these gloves get stained , hand wash them . i put mine through the washing machine and they shrank slightly -- but not enough to prevent me from using them ! ! 
they did come in the original package . by tags , not sure what you mean . they had bar code on packaging and i do n't remember if there were any tags on them . i had purchased one in a store a couple years ago and loved it . these were iddntical , just cleaner . i really like these gloves . so easy to slip on and off ... .i have . arthritis in my hands so i needed the ease of on and off plus easy flexibility . i hope this helps . 
yes 
as far as i can tell they are the real deal , original gloves . he box and everything is identical to the boxes and gloves sold at a retail store . 
yes and works quite well . 
they fit the wide mouth , store bought , mason jars . as an aside , these things are awesome ! i keep all herbs , spices , seeds , grains , coffee and whatnot sealed up and they are very fresh when opened . this little device does get bunged up if you try to vacuum seal powders though . just keep enough head-space between the lid and the powder so it does n't get drawn up and it will seal fine . 
yes but air dry to avoid cracking over time 
yes . the manufacturer offers an adapter that mates the foodsaver vacuum hose with the thriftyvac check valve , the black center piece of the thriftyvac mason jar vacuum lid . 
hi bridget . yes , but be sure to order the `` wide mouth '' vacuum lids , because half gallon size mason jars only come with that size opening . regards , tom cannon . 
yes , provided you have the thriftyvac check valve adapter . however , you can get a much stronger vacuum using the manual pump that comes with the thriftyvac system , and you would not need an adapter . 
yes it does . and it works wonderfully ! ! in fact , it works better then some of mine more expensive sealers 
on the top , surrounding the on off switch . 
i find it is pretty loud . it definitely can not be characterized as quiet or unnoticeable . 
recommended for rooms up to 257 square feet . 
yes . 
this unit requires two hepa filters ( hapf600 ) and two carbon filters ( hapf60 ) . 
no . 
no 
not terribly noisy . you 'll be able to hear it from another room but not to the point where it would interfere with you . 
yes . 
i 've used it on ours in the kitchen . it cleans the surface well . i just keep it away from any edges that are loose . since it uses water steam , it could get underneath and cause it to bubble up . 
the broom in the front is rotating and pick up dust . so no need to sweep first . but the broom will not get to the edge . 
this is powered with a 110 volt power chord 
the inside is a dark brown , but be aware that the lid does n't fit well at all . i was very disappointed in it . 
no 
unfortunatly china , but we bought two and they have withstood the dishwasher and use well . 
i have the simple home creations 16 x 11.5 '' mat . works fine . it has 12 circles , 1.5 '' in diameter , and 1.5 '' apart . i do n't use the circles because i try to get more than 12 of whatever i am baking on the mat . 
i 've never made macarons but everything i 've baked on it has come out great . no stick and extremely easy to clean . it 's heat resistant to 430f . 
it 's around 1mm 
it fits a half baking sheet . 
there are two types of canning : boiling-water canning at 100c 212f ( for acid fruits , tomatoes , pickles and jellied products ) and pressure canning at 115~121c 240~250f ( for low acid vegetables , meat and poultry ) . please refer to `` usda complete guide to home canning '' for more details . instant pot can be used for boiling-water canning . however , instant pot has not been tested for food safety in pressure canning by usda . due to the fact that programs in instant pot ip-csg , ip-lux and ip-duo series are regulated by a pressure sensor instead of a thermometer , the elevation of your location may affect the actual cooking temperature . for now , we would n't recommend using instant pot for pressure canning purpose . please note this correction to our early inaccurate information . 
instant pot ip-duo has dual pressure settings : high 10.2 ~ 11.6psi ( 70 ~ 80kpa ) ; low 5.8 ~7.2 psi ( 40 ~ 50kpa ) 
instant pot ip-duo has two temperatures for making yogurt : 36 ~ 43c ( 96.8 ~ 109.4f ) ; and 30 ~ 34c ( 86 ~ 93.2f ) . it can be program to run 99 hours 30 minutes . if your starter works in these two temperature ranges , instant pot ip-duo can be used to make yogurt with any alternative milks . 
i usually cook black beans , pinto beans or lentils . i soak over night and cook for 15 minutes on high pressure with natural cool down . come out perfectly for me . soft , but not mushy . 
the pot is manufactured in china . the company is located on ottawa , canada . 
you can always cook frozen meat . i frequently have put frozen hamburger in a skillet simultaneously friying it and thawing it out right there in the pan constantly scraping off the outer layer as it cooks and defrosts at the same time . you can do this in the instant pot on the saute setting . in any pressure cooker ( the instant pot is primarily used as a pressure cooker ) you can put a whole frozen chicken , stew meat , frozen chiie block with two inches of water , making beef stew or chicken soup and just cook it about 5 minutes longer in the pressure cooker than unfrozen meat . it works very well . a pressure cooker unthaws frozen meat rather quickly as it cooks at about 240 degrees . no need to defrost first . you can take the meat put in the morning , put it in a dish in the morning and it will bee defrosted when you get home from work , but that is not necessary . just take it out of the freezer and throw it in the pressure cooker . it will cook just the same as unfrozen , just give it a few extra minutes bottom line - frozen is no big deal . w.o . 
you could probably do this using the `` saute '' feature . 
i believe so . i have not seen any rust . 
no . all genuine teak `` ages '' . since it is never going to be exposed to sunlight , i do n't know if color will change . we 've had it quite some time now and are very pleased with the bench . 
i have one , love it by the way , and have sat on it in the shower and it held me just fine 
i did not put a protective coating on this table - it is in the corner of my shower and gets wet and does fine - i use it to hold my large shampoo bottle and to prop my foot up on while shaving my leg - works great 
there is a reddish undertone but it 's not too drastic 
i really do not know . i googled `` bpa plastic bags '' seems bpa is used in most plastic . still like i said i do not know , there is nothing on the bags or packaging that are bpa free . the label does say they are `` eco-friendly packaging for online sales only '' 
yes 
sadley ... they do not say anywhere on packaging where they are made..say `` eco friendly ' ... .not impressed ! 
i am sorry , but i completely forget to check that . 
i would n't , only because of the type of plastic and the fact that you have liquid and air in the sleeve , may pop it open ! works great just tying them up , make sure your knot is tight or you will end up with leakage . 
approximately 12x2 inches and can hold about 3 4 cup liquid with room to tie the top . 
hello ! it depend on where you living , it usually takes about 7-15 working days to us , uk , ca and au . 
dear : currently we only do the same orange color as shown in drama , thank you for your interest . 
mine is orange 
yes.we pack it in gift box . 
good 
very easy 
only the first filter is permanent and is easily cleaned , but as i have not had to replace the interior filters i have no idea what they cost . 
yes 
try unplugging the unit to reset it 
yes 
yes 
no , i only here the noise of the fan . 
the cup holder lights have an on off button , but the buttons themselves light up . they stay lit as long as the couch is plugged in . they are n't very bright though , if that 's your concern . let me know if you have any other questions . my fiance and i bought this couch , and are very satisfied with it so far . it 's a very space-age sofa with all the bells and whistles . ; ) 
the footrest reclines to horizontal . the backrest reclines to a little past 45 degrees . not quite flat but still good for resting . 
overall width is 85 '' for the three seat version . 
the controls for the seat and headrest are built into the cupholder . 
like , a single reclining chair ? i have n't seen one , but i know there is a matching love seat , but it 's about the same price . so you might as well get the full sofa . 
these bags are made of food grade nylon ( nylon 6 or nylon 6,6 ) . they are bpa free and bleach is not involved in the production process . food grade nylon is among the safer plastics one can use in terms of stability . any risk of leaching , and none has been demonstrated , would likely occur above the glass transition temperature ( 116.6 deg f for nylon 6 ) . the issue has not been extensively studied but it 's generally assumed to be safe , whatever thats worth . it 's not an answer but nylon is used in many tea bags and this is what any study would relate to since the tea market is still much larger than the nut milk bag market . if you are especialy concerned keep it under 116.6 deg f and it should be perfectly safe . 
good question , wondering myself . especially if you are putting acidic or hot foods in it . and for long periods of time like coffee . nylon is a kind of plastic after all . ? and no plastic is totally safe . but i can see using it for quick uses on nonacidic and cold foods ? 
yes , i believe so . i know it would be very full with that amount : ) 
i would like more information about the material it is made from also . people who use these bags and the producer are probably interested in health , so i 'm sure they 've researched what is a very safe material ? hopefully . it would be nice to share that information . 
the listing states 75. but , the listing also states that the 200 micron bags are tighter & strain out more than the 75 micron bags . no way . a 75 micron bag is a lot finer ( tighter ) than a 200 micron bag . the listing can not be trusted with the contradictory information . 
i turn it inside then just use warm soapy water . 
the product description says that it is 8 inches by 9.25 inches . a 1-gallon zip bag is 10 by 11 inches , so i expect this bag should hold almost 3 cups . 
it 's big enough for many nuts . we 're using it for almond milk , and can accommodate about 3 cups of almonds after hydration . that is - 3 cups of dry almonds , hydrated and ground fit just fine . 
yes . 
i am sorry i am unable to answer your question . i am not even sure how to measure circumference for you ... 
yes . these have been through the high heat of the dishwasher dry cycle without issue . 
i have n't put them in the dishwasher yet 
i have the box they came in it says optix 28 ounce tumbler assorted colors . us acrylic llc libertyville illinois 60048. i do not think they are tupperware i really like them nice glasses for the price and they are bpa free ! hope it helps 
i purchased the clear ... and i do n't have any problem . but i only use them inside .

i ment to warn my 400 lb . son not to sit on the love seat , i was worried it might not support his weight . before i had a chance to tell him he was settled on the love seat with the dog , he has sat on the love seat numerous times since with no problem . i think the `` real wood '' construction and center legs make it sturdy enough for just about anyone . 
no 
neither . it 's a couch . it does not pull out into a bed or anything of the sort . 
~ 34 ' . seating pillows are not very stable and sliding out . 
the cushions are plenty think and i would say the firmness is a 3 . 
purchased last year . great . pain to clean but worth it 
yes , in fact i can never hear it . 
no . 
not now .

yes , in my opinion it is . the picture is absolutely beautiful without the `` glowing '' effect . it glowed the very first night i hung it even though i have a northern exposure in my bedroom . it 's sort of like looking out a window late at night on a foggy evening . you see a black silhouette of this majestic tree . also , you have to take into consideration that it originates from romania and travels through customs in nyc and all shipping fees , taxes , etc . are included in the price . 
hello , it is a real photo . 
1 '' 
yes 
it 's more classified as a blender -- fruit or veggie : e.g , apples , pears , peaches , kiwis , carrots , celery , etc totally break down and blend together all parts of the fruit veggie to include all the fiber , vitamins , nutrients into your juice or smoothie drink . i believe traditional juicers remove the fiber from juice veggies at least the one i had did . so in a sense i guess it could be considered a high performance juicer but much much more ! hope this helps ! 
revised my response june 8 , 2014 : returned this system to store & interesting enough , the clerk said she had rec 'd several as returns since december 2013 w similar complaint . got this as a xmas 2013 present ( hubby paid $ 179.00+tax for system ) . the individual smoothie system is gr8 , blends well and smooth . excellent power ! however , the food processer malfunctioned . have used it to make pizza dough , cookies & bread ( overall about 5 times ) . worked okay for pulse but then red light began to flash when making cookies , so had to check overall system , checked connection , base placement , food processor lock feature , when making bread after a few times , the base became unstable ( shakey ) . i unlocked base and made certain the table surface was free of debris and again , placed locked base ... after a few seconds , base became wobbly again . i checked all applicable areas on system to ensure they were connected , locked in place prior to returning to store . note : i had replaced my cuisinart food processer and mixer with this system but glad i did n't throw out because i had to revert to using them again . just wanted to update based on my experience with system as of today ! by the way i noticed alice 's reference is for another model ninja mega kitchen system the seller is selling an entirely different system , see the graphic provided by seller & # 9658 ; supra kitchen system i have this system . this system has 1200 watts 1.5 horse power and here 's what is included : xl blender : 72 oz pitcher w pour spout , 6 blade assembly xl food processer mixer dough maker : 8 cup bowl , 4 blade assembly , dough blade two single serve cups ( nutrient & vitamin extraction and frozen blending , smoothies ) , 2 travel lids , single serve blades , instruction booklet recipe booklet good luck ! 
i 'm not familiar with ninja mega , but i googled it and mega has more power , 1500 watts whereas this has 1200 watts . price for mega is about 10.00 more . look here to read more http : www.amazon.com ninja-mega-kitchen-system-bl771 dp b00a3d5iz6

you do want a coarse grind for a french press coffee maker . the key is letting the coffee steep long enough to make a strong brew . we recommend grounding your beans right before you brew your first pot . our customers have had the best results using a hand grinder like this one : http : www.amazon.com dp b00pvvkh42 as a general rule , if you are at a higher altitude , then you need to add time because boiling water is cooler . i have good results with a 5 minute steep time . ( note that i am at 5000ft , so 5 minutes may be too long for you , at a normal altitude try closer to 4 minutes ) be sure to use a timer , and compare different times to find the optimal brew . you can make good tasting coffee with finer grounds , but they may clog the filter , or if they are too fine , they might pass through it altogether , giving you a rather gritty pot of coffee . 
the screen is stainless or it would have rusted by now . the part on the strainer looks to be stainless . the rod part is hard to tell maybe a different quality of stainless then the other parts ? i do n't think there is any aluminum in it . is it just me or does `` mike robison '' sound like he is pitching this product ? it 's as easy to clean as any other french press that i have used anywhere in the world . what qualifies any of these people besides the manufacture to state the materials it is made of ? the description does say all stainless steel , borosilicate glass , and strong bpa free plastic . 
yes the coffee press will with stand boiling water . however , it 's generally better to add the water just after it stops boiling , wait about a minute before adding it , water should not be actively boiling when you pour it in one of these so as not to burn or even destroy the beneficial constituents . hope this helps , ~team idylc homes 
let the carafe cool first ; otherwise , the metal parts are very hot to touch . after you remove the press from the carafe , clasp on to the bottom metal piece of the rod ( opposite end from the black knob ) with your right hand while spinning the plunger disk to its left or away from yourself . if the metal is too small or slippery to grasp , try using a rubber dish-washing glove or something similar to get a good grip . do n't hold & unscrew from the rubber knob . here is a short video of my demonstration 
yes , absolutely ... here is how we recommend brewing hot tea as a tea press . ~ clean off coffee residues from mesh filter , if significant amount consider a vinegar & water mixture . ~ prepare amount of water needed for the cups of tea going to be poured as soon as the first steep of tea is complete . ~ add 1 teaspoon of your favorite tea leaf per 8 ounces of water used . if stronger flavor is desired , add more tea , not time . ~ lower plunger halfway to bottom . the idea is not to compress but to use the plunger as a sieve . compressing tea leaves may produce bitter results . ~ pour off all tea . do n't leave any tea steeping in water for an extended period of time . ~ re-steep tea leaves as many times as you find they produce a tasty cup . ~ for more information about how to steep your favorite teas check out our tea chart here & gt ; & gt ; http : ecx.images-amazon.com images i 81vvq1gtr8l._sl1500_.jpg hope this helps , team idylc homes 
you need room for the coffee and the press filter , so 3.5 cups is what i usually get . you get 3 `` clean '' 8oz cups- after that it can get a bit `` muddy '' depending on your grind ( coarse is better ) , how long you let it settle ( patience grasshopper ) and if you pour it all out slowly at one go ( going back to the upright position between pours muddies it ) . the press is 34 oz . so therefore , roughly between 3 to 4 cups . 
this is a trick question lol . you need to use `` coarse coffee grinds '' however i used maxwell house fine ground beans . the only down fall is i may of used to much because some parts where a dark brown color . i would suggest grinding the coffee coarse like there directions say ( after you buy it has directions on box ) 
hello sir , if i understand your question correctly , your asking if there is a manual mode speed adjustment in which you can control each of the fans speeds without interference from the automatic mode - if so the answer is yes . this unit provides excellent control functionality allowing the user to manipulate the speed of the fan in any configuration . the only exception to this is the 'aera+ mode ' which can only be leveraged in automatic mode . i hope this helps answer your question . i myself am very pleased with this purchase given the deal i found - it was a 'deal of the day ' that also , ( if one paid attention ) , had a coupon to clip for additional savings . by the time i reached checkout , i owed only $ 109 . after using it for sometime now , i would have easily paid what they are asking for today . anyways , let me know if need any additional information . regards , -a.farrow 
here is the list of california certified air cleaning devices which test for ozone emissions these fellowes are on it just do ctrl + f and type in fel http : www.arb.ca.gov research indoor aircleaners certified.htm 
label on the unit says : `` made in china . '' 
it comes with one each . you have to pull them out and take the plastic out though . 
i did ! no more sneezing when i wake up in the mornings ! 
no , not all all . we love ours . the filters last a long time . it blows great and is quit unless you have it full blast . we run ours on low , and on high at night for the fan noise . i never smelled anything from it , even when the filter needed changing . good luck . 
i have used this temporarily in my kitchen after i burned some food in the oven . it removed the majority of the smell and smoke . 
stainless steel ... 
yes you can if you want a whole ice tray 
not until ice has formed . 
usa 
yes very comfortable . sleeping is not super comfy but you do n't want guests to stay that long anyway 
yes , the pillow is included . chair works well . 
it took a bit of figuring out between the sparse diagram provided and some trial and error . 2 of the leg are packed inside the unit behind a zipper . undo those first and extend the legs . you should be able to figure it out from there . hope this helps . 
approx . 18 '' . 
if you are fond of a very firm sleeping surface , it would be ok ... .it is well made , but i do not find it at all comfortable , sad to say . 
i do not know . for the temporary period that i have it , it looks working well . 
yes use the screws and allen wrench it 's easy

across the top the basket is 10 1 4 x 7 1 8 `` the bottom is 9 x 5 `` the basket is 5 1 2 '' tall . it is sturdily built . margaret 
i only have one . but being the bottom is narrower than the top i would say no . 
no . i do n't recommend using it for cleaning products . i bought them for my kids to play `` kitchen '' with play food . they are rather small and not sturdy with low handles . hope that helps 
designed in utah and assembled in china . we have two and both are great ! very loud and accurate which is what we needed . hope this helps . 
it uses a 9 volt battery which , with normal use , should last for over a year . i absolutely love this timer ! 
99 hours 99 mins and 99 seconds 
the thermoworks extra big and loud has be manually shut off . 
yes . the regular size paper filters work just fine and i think they do a better job filtering the coffee grounds than the permanent filter . 
it 's great for no overflow ! i have n't had a problem at all . however , with my last coffee pot , a cuisinart , i kept it on a tray , to keep the overflows from running all over my counters . 
do n't buy it = pos 
no , it does n't . it does not blow with a fan , it radiates the heat . excellent heater , we have three of them : ) 
that 's where i use mine . it has a safety button on the bottom so if it falls over it shuts off . still , i would n't put it on the tub ledge unless you like to live dangerously . 
there are no user serviceable parts in this heater , nor are any for sale . replacing heating tubes would require a trip back to the factory . if there is a manufacturer defect get a replacement unit under warranty . 
the cord on ours is five feet . 
no 
no 
do n't know the exact meaurements but it is for small rooms . 
the center portion of the cabinet is metal , the rest is plastic 
i do n't know why not ? not done that but we have jused every thing else . 
these are two separate units by the manufacturer , though similar . you may be able to contact the manufacturer , as listed in the amazon spec , to see if it is possible to buy the top squeezer and attach it to the one you have without the top . but i belive you will have to buy the one with the top . 
the juicer holes are in the head of the owner , excuse me , in the head of the unit . 
i found no paperwork to that effect . mine has had no issues thus far . 
the cushions arrive compressed in a bag with all the air removed and the instructions tell you to put on the covers immediately . i have n't had to clean the cushions but i imagine it may be a tight fit but not impossible .

hi linda & gt ; amazon 's free shipping threshold is now $ 35 on purchases ... so you 'd have to order 3 to get the free shipping . 
i have not but it sounds like something i would like to try . i 'm sure it would work , it would just have to be sliced in half most likely . 
no 
you should receive an email with a link . 
personally , i have never tried this with cucumber . i figure it is to water filled to stay firm enough for veggie noodles . i use zucchini . 
papalardo sends most items the same day . priority mail with expedited shippping takes 2-3 days . 
it come as a sheet and i think they are somewhat perforated , but i ended up using a round cookie biscuit cutter to cut them out . 
they will work on any frosting , just needs to be large enough cookie for the toppers as they melt onto the frosting after 15-30 minutes . 
i am not sure . i advised the children with the above allergies not to eat the cupcakes . 
yes . that is what i used them for . they worked great . 
yes 
it is a shallow fry pan , not a sauce pan . i was able to fill it to the brim using 2 quarts plus 1 cup of water . 
i have natural gas stove -happy with it-as far as putting it in the oven i do not do that.the handle maybe a problem . 
the techef 11 '' lid . amazon has this item as well . ! note the lid comes unassembled . there are a grand total of 4 or 5 parts ( i am looking at mine and trying to remember if there is a washer involved . you 'll need a medium phillips head screwdriver . the lid has a really cool venting mechanism that directs the steam heat away from your hand . the heat resistant glass is mildly smoked in color and easy to see through . 
i have had good results with this pan on my single burner induction cook top . it is made of the correct material and the bottom is thick and the pan is heavy to allow for frying at the high temperatures generated by induction units . what problems have you experienced ?

the bottom of the pan is attracted to the stove magnetism . i 'm no engineer and i do n't know exactly how it works , but it does work . the bottom of the pan is not aluminum and it is specially built onto the pan . 
7.5 - 8 inches.= ~19 - 24 cm . those are the inside and outside dimensions of the structural ring on the bottom of the pan . the ferric plate that is inside the pan , and that provides the induction compatability is located within the aluminum cladding of the pan . 
yes - do it all the time 
have n't really had that issue . i guess it would depend on how much is spilled ? for me typically there are just a couple drips that might run down the cup and never even get to the `` saucer '' just a nice backup to full saucer 
overseas i think it was funny because it came from over there and i had to send it to england 
one 
it seams to be . this is actually a very nice and strong cup . i had ordered a cheaper one and broke it before i used it . this is a quality cup . 
yes it will i put it in it has worked perfect good ice maker they last about 5-7 years 
no , it did not . 
installed the one i ordered in a whirpool . 
the one listed by hotspot electronics is a kit and may include additional items 
i recommend that you telephone whirlpool customer service . 
i googled your refrigerator model number , and it appears this ice maker will fit . please visit http : www.repairclinic.com shop-for-parts a4b5c47d577632 model-ed25lfxgb00-whirlpool-refrigerator-ice-maker-parts to confirm ! the ice maker they show on the repair clinic page is the whirlpool 4317943 . 
yes it comes completely assembled . 
6 of the approx . 2 oz.plastic jars 
it fit in mine . i looked everywhere for one that would fit and this was the only one that i found because the depth of my cabinets were so short . i ordered two of them - great quality and price ! 
it is 10 inches across . 
yes . this mattress is covered by a 10 year limited warranty . please retain your receipt as your warranty record . thank you . 
4 lbs is the density of the foam . please let us know if you have any more questions . 
i do n't think it would be too much of a problem but we were pretty careful about putting it in an extra room on the floor spread out and leaving the window open to let it air out and expand as much as physically possible . we gave it a few days to make sure it was good to go . if you do n't have enough room to do that , then i would continue flipping it on each side upright so that it does n't unevenly expand . 
yes , i 'm finding it better made , heavier and the motor is a lot stronger , i 'm not worried at all about it breaking . thought i 'd let you know , on all models not all the fruit goes through and there is quite of bit of waste left in the blades . i love this though ! try freezing cubes of soy milk or coconut butter in ice cube trays to add to the fruit . i use a lot of vanilla and cinnamon too . hope you enjoy it . 
if you plan on using this magical machine more than just occasionally because you want healthy desserts without all the artificial additives , then the elite is the way to go . the regular machine does the job and makes yummy desserts . but ( there 's always a `` but '' ) its motor strains when the mostly frozen fruit is rammed through the shoot . that makes it a very noisy ( think ear-plug-worthy ) machine . it also shimmies and shakes when making the frozen goodies . it just feels as if it needs a rest after making just a couple of servings . the elite is a sturdier workhorse . its motor is up to the job , and so are all the components . it is a heavier machine and i do n't feel as if it is working hard when i make a big batch of something divine and healthy . and it is much more quiet . it still makes noise , but it 's possible to talk with someone standing next to you and hear them as you are making your dessert -- something not possible with the regular yonana . the unit does n't vibrate or strain -- it just turns large chunks of frozen bananas or fruit into creamy , yummy deliciousness . both machines are a breeze to wash and put back together . i think the right machine for you will come down to how much you think you will use it and your noise tolerance . 
almost every recipe in the booklet calls for bananas , but i use other fruits alone all the time . 
you can make as much or as little as you want ! i generally set up serving bowls and frozen fruit and make fruity combinations as requested ! because you control how much fruit you want to use for a serving , you can make as few or as many as you wish ! when i use it , i make 3 or 4 servings . our family loves this ! 
not at all . their recipe book includes recipes to make sorbet , which uses no bananas . i personally love strawberries and raspberries , and you can use them frozen to make sorbet , frozen pies , etc . 
much better built , stronger motor , does n't make as much noise , uses less plastic and more metal parts . 
a more powerful motor . therefore it works faster and with less pressure . 
250w 
yes , it does work with wheatgrass . however , this machine makes the juicing process awkward and laborious as the suction cup feet continually loses gripping power , causing the machine to move around quite a bit . also , on a scale of 1-10 ( with 10 being the best and 1 being poor ) , i would rate the amount of juice extraction a 2 . 
nope . this is for very small amounts only . in my opinion you would be better off getting an electric juicer . 
no . made in china . 
if you 're asking can it juice carrots , the answer is y.e.s. ! ! ! ! 
of course not . why would it ? once the insides of the fruit is cut open , you already start losing nutrients . you also lose the pulp that comes out the other end . 
it 's 14inches . but it 's a difficult bed to assemble and it 's weak . good luck ! 
it 's wood but legs and slats are too skimpy ( 1x4 material ) and to hold a person over 140 lbs in my opinion . i 'm making a support frame of 2x4 for the middle under the bed . 
no it does not and one more important thing is that in the photo they put its queen but its really twin and vice verse in queen photo they put twin size just be advised . 
a little over a foot but i have box springs so the bed sits higher . this frame is only for a mattress 
it is 16.5 '' x12.5 '' 
it can hold a plate with up to 11 '' to 12 '' diameter securely . 
13 '' wide , 15 1 1 '' long and 1 1 `` thick , when folded 
for dimensions information , you may refer to this picture ( the 3rd picture of the product ) : http : ecx.images-amazon.com images i 71dxaetj9ql._sl1500_.jpg 
dear crystal m. of course it is ! however as a user and lover of the product first ( and not pers as a seller ) even though it 's dishwasher safe , i would recommend you to use one of the two brushes to clean the blades before you put it into the dishwasher . from my own experience this takes about 10 seconds and you just want to be sure nothings stays stuck between the blades due to hygienic reasons . my first spiral slicer had no brush , or whatsoever . and when i tried to use it the second time , i saw all this old vegetable parts between the blades which started to mold . very unappetising . i hope this answers your question . you get two free brushes to make sure this will not happen to you . kind regards , all times finest 
yes , if the beet is large enough . there is a device that comes with it that you can push the vegetable down into the slicer . it works on carrots , etc . 
hi sanibelle , i 've never used the gefu . this is the first spiralizer we have ever used owned . we are really happy with it . we use it multiple times a week . we regularly use it to make zucchini noodles and sweet potato mac and cheese . i have also used it with regular baking potatoes . i highly recommend it ! great value and quality . -monica 
instead of the end caps being black , one is red and one is green . they are `` protective '' caps so your fingers do n't get to the blade . you remove the caps to use the slicer . 
a small one at the end that is cone shaped . it really does n't waste very much of the vegetable . 
yes they are , we have washed ours in the dishwasher many times and they still look new . we love these measuring spoons . 
china 
you could use the spoons without taking them off the ring , but it is much easier if you use them individually . 
im not an expert on the gauge of steel , but these are made well and durable 
ha ha ! the large ring they are on would fit through an earring hole that is larger than a simple piercing , say something like a small guage . the weight might be off-putting after a while , but i would imagine they could be worn for an hour or so comfortably . 
the ring is 2 inches in diameter 
according to the product description , `` usable in heats up to 420 degrees f. '' i would surmise that applies to microwaves , but it is n't specified in the ad copy . however , most heating scenarios would cause pressure to build so , if one of these lids is sealed tight to a container , there would likely be a sudden and messy , if not hazardous , release of that pressure . i have not yet purchased this product , so i do n't know if there are additional instructions included that might allow such use . 
absolutely ... .they were made for this application . we have used them for years in microwave ovens . 
yes they can go in the microwave not the oven . 
these lids are not what i expected . they do not stretch much at all . they are barely useable . 
not sure where they are made , but they are garbage . they rip when you stretch them . 
it 's either a rayon or polyester synthetic fill that has a similar feel to down . these comforters are great for people who are allergic to down but want that soft , comfy feeling . i have two of them for our guest rooms and have been happy with them . 
it depends how cool you keep your house . we set our thermostat at 67 at night in the winter , and my daughter was comfortable most nights . she was cold the nights weather outside was down in the high teens and low 20 's . we also have a coverlet over the top , and a fleece blanket and flannel sheets under the cover so you might be just right with sheets and duvet only . have n't had it through a summer yet . 
no . it does not . i had to like spin the corner ends and then tie the ties inside my duvet cover around the corners . 
i am using this as a duvet insert and have n't had it long enough to remove it . but that being said , unless the manufacturer says it ok to wash it of course i would not . 
yes 
thanks for posting your question , according to the product description , this sorter measures 20 '' h x 30 '' w x 14.5 '' d , each bag 14 '' w. i hope this helps ! 
yes . the bags only sit on the frame . they are super easy to take off the mail frame . and are good quality material . 
each one is 14 '' x17 '' 
29.5 '' wide 17.5 '' deep 29 '' high 
there 's an instruction manual in the product . you will need a phillips screwdriver . the product is labeled with alphabetized label . 
it is inside and easy 
21 inches tall , 29 inches wide , and 17 inches deep . ( the height does not include the extra length where the handles are ) & # 128512 ; 
do n't purchase it . mine came with missing hardware and i have been battling the co for 6 mos . i recieved a notice that they were discontinued , no refund , no response from the co ... stuck with a piece of trash 
the chefalarm will work great for frying . you can use the included stainless steel pot clip to position the probe into the oil . the pro-series probes have a range up to 572 degrees f which should easily accommodate frying temperatures . the cable on the high-temp cooking probe can withstand temps up to 700f . 
it only has one temp probe input , so if you only wanted to monitor the oven , then yes . if you wanted to monitor your food and the oven temp , you would need a monitor with dual inputs . there might be better temp probes for the job though ( check the thermoworks website for options ) , the needle probe is not ideally suited for measuring air temp , but it does do the job . 
yes 
2 aaa 
it will work great for bread . simply insert the probe to the center of your loaf and set the high alarm to your target temperature . 
yes rob . 
i 'm sorry , i 'm not sure but you should contact chuck ! he will set you straight larry 
manufacturer indicates that it can be used with box spring or board . we are currently using it with a box spring . great mattress for the price . 
no box spring - just the mattress . 
no ma'am . 
it should . 
mattress is covered with a mattress pad and then sheets , and these are washed weekly . 
i have n't tried to put it in the dishwasher i just wash it by hand . 
i agree ! i plan to write a description on each in a permanent marker ( fine tip sharpie ) such as `` curls '' or `` thick spirals '' to help me tell them apart . 
instructions on how to use this product is actually printed on the packaging box : ) if you have any more questions , please message us and we will be more than happy to assist you . 
dear chen , thank you for your inquiry . the weight capacity is 2 to 2.5 lbs . thank you for allowing me to be of service to you . kind regards , audrey consumer relations 
dear amna ali , thank you for your inquiry . the farberware 10.5 '' stir fry will hold approximately 2 - 2.5 quarts . we hope you find this information helpful . thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . kind regards , audrey consumer relations 
no screw is required . handle fits snug on mounting . 
yes , but it did n't come with the handle . 
this is a more popular color . otherwise , the models are the same . 
it comes from a single hole in the bottom . but it has no problem circulating the kernel 's 
no 
this item is matte red . 
yes it does . i love this popper and it looks great too : ) 
no . this for make popcorn 
cuisinart does not recommend to roast coffee in the machine . 
yes , to both questions . 
14.5 inches 
yes , the start button is actually an `` add 30 seconds '' button that will turn it on for 30 seconds initially and add 30 every time after . 
it is 20.5 inches wide by 14.5 inches deep and 12 .75 inches high . 
yes it does . it 's actually pretty bright . 
20.5 length across by 14.5 width . the height is 12 and three quarters if your looking to see if it fits under your counter . 
it appears to be a white colored aluminum metal . 
no , it does not . 
i love mine , the t-fal p2510737 unit . this unit is really only for pressure cooking , not pressure canning . the new types are so much easier than the old ones that could overpressurize . one thing that is really important , let the unit vent steam for several minutes before closing it to make sure you get a good seal . the instructions were not a clear on that but i knew to do it from pressure canning . 
yes it is . 
the table height is adjustable from 21.75 '' to 29.25 '' 
some do and some do n't . mine does n't have one . it may be because it is a table mate 2 . 
it has a release bar under the table . this item is not worth the cost , try ebay . 
flat service : 14 '' x 19 '' . including rolled edges : 15 1 4 '' x 20 1 4 '' . 
the answer is 3 cup bowl 5.3 x 3 ( 750 ml 13.5 cm x 7.6 cm ) 6 cup bowl 6.8 x 3.4 ( 1.5 l 17.2 cm x 8.6 cm ) 10 cup bowl 8.3 x 3.7 ( 2.5 l 21 cm x 9.4 cm ) 4.5 quart bowl 10.6 x 4.2 ( 4.5 l 26.9 cm x 10.7 cm ) 4 matching lids . i hope that this was helpful . 
according to the world kitchen website ( corningware and pyrex are registered trademarks of corning incorporated used under license by world kitchen , llc . ) , the lids are bpa free . 
yes , they say freezer to oven , but i always let them warm up a bit , just in case . love them . 
i would n't recommend putting these in dishwasher . most likely you would have the same problem . 
yes they can . the glass is very thick and durable . however , since you control the hand mixer , you can limit its contact with the walls of the bowl . 
i do not cook popcorn in a bowl , in the microwave . however , if it is a microwave safe bowl then probably ok. i would check it out with the manufacturer of the product . i hoped this helped you . we do love the bowls , first set lasted 20 years . we gave them away to a person of need , only because of many scratch marks within the bowls ... luv em . 
no . the pancakes are only on the bottom half . we used to have a ge waffle griddle years ago that did open flat but this one does n't . but , it 's the best waffle maker we 've had , we love it . it makes the best waffles and is so easy to use . 
no , can not be flipped , but we have found no reason to wish that it was ! works great , and we love it ! totally agree with comments from dj giles . and , great recipes come with it ! every saturday morning is great at our house ! : - ) 
it comes with 2 waffle plates and 2 pancake plates . all are removable and dishwasher safe . it 's a terrific product . 
8 '' square ... it makes 4 - 4 '' square waffles . we love this waffle maker ! 
not very , that 's mostly why i returned it . i wanted `` belgian '' and they were slightly larger then regular . 
no - it does not . plus it beeps when the griddle is ready and again when the waffles are done . 
the sticker on the bottoms says '' 1200 watts '' 
the skillet measures 9.5 inchs . we have owned and used this skillet for at several months and it continues to look like new . we have closely followed the directions for use . m. sams 
i have never tried to use it in my oven . but i am still using almost daily on top of the stove . been one of the best small skillets i have owned . 
no 
no lid come with it and i have never seen any lid sold separately either . however , any other lid for similar size pan or pot fits , so i use a lid from other pan if needed and works perfect . why you want to clatter your kitchen cabinet with more lid ? ? ? 
i use my all the time on my ceramic top stove . i love my pan . 
it 's not so loud but you can hear it . i got used to it after a while . i have it in the bedroom . it 's not so bad . does the job for me . keeps everything cool but not super cold . just cool . 
plugs into the lighter slot and it comes with it . i'v never used it . i have mine at work . 
nope . there it 's a latch . 
i would not recommend this cooler . i got it for trips in the car and it failed miserably . the salad i was supposibly refrigerating was warm at the end of the trip . seemed to work when i tested it but failed sometime during the trip . have not used it since . 
no 
it is very lightweight . without a comforter inside it weighs the same as a basic sheet . 
i bought a duvet cover and two pillow shams . 
the package says china . 
it 's pretty small . i just recycled the box yesterday . an educated guess would be 12x14 
antique brass 
persons that weight 180+ have sat on them with no problem 
yes you must attach the back to the seat bottom and attach each leg.very ez to do . just love these chairs . i did spray with scotch guard fabric protector too . 
i weigh 195lb and several of my friends weigh over 275lb . i do n't know what the mfgr suggests , but i feel safe enough to buy 2more . 
softer than burlap but impossible to put together . holes not drilled all the way , wabbly , screws do n't fit right . 
light beige 
no it does not . 
china 
sometimes but not always . if it tips the lid fills and does n't drain back down in the bottom so when you take the lid off you get water on you which is a real mess . 
no 
nope , not at all . 
not unless it was a very skinny straw . there are 4 parts , the bottle itself , the main cap , the section that goes inside the bottle for fruit , etc. , which is perforated to allow the water to pass through for the infusion process , and the 'lid ' for that section , which has small , oval holes which sieve the infused water through . the 'lip ' you drink from is thin enough to where there is no 'dribbling ' when you drink . great contraption , i really like mine . 
yes i believe it will . i have a sleep number mattress , with the 3 '' memory foam topper on top of that , and it fit fine . 
yes and it is very easy to put your bed 
i 'm not 100 % certain because i can not actually compare it on both mattresses , but my impression is it will not fit a waterbed mattress . 
i have not had an issue , but i bought it in the winter - in nh . i have not experienced it in the summer , yet . 
you will have to contact the seller for this question . i bought the twin size . 
inside the frame , it is 2-3 inches longer and wider than a queen mattress so the mattress does not exactly fit in the frame but it is ok for me . for outer dimensions add 3inches on the sides and 4 inches on the longer part on top of the regular queen size mattress 
at least 10 '' 
crock pot is actually the brand name of the original slow cooker ( still made today ) . since the patents ran out many years ago on the design and function , many companies now make slow cookers , but they ca n't call them a crock pot due to legal issues that may arise . 
the heating elements are on the bottom and around the sides of the slow cooker . 
yes it is , which makes it much easier to clean . but if you 're planning on transporting cooked food it 's best to take the whole thing , since the clamps on the lid hook only to the outer portion . 
the lid is glass with a nice squishy rubber seal around it . 
no . the 'programmable ' part only lets you set the amount of time you want it to cook on high or low . 
the outer part and the directions are from china , however , the ceramic liner does n't say where it was made , only that it was imported . 
no . it is just the comforter . you have to purchase the sheets separately but they are nice sheets ! 
no , it does n't . : - ( 
gently use a screw driver or butter knife to get under the trim ring to get it out . 
i do n't know , think it fits all ge mics , it did mine . 
i bought mine for model # jvm135obw . i did a search for my part number on the manufacturer website and then bought it off of amazon . 
i am not able to help as i do not know what models it fits or does not fit . it did fit the microwave for which i ordered it . i do know that it is the bottom screw where the break occurs . ge did a poor job in design and manufacture . 
we do n't believe it did . 
9.5 inches . i 'm not sure about almond , but to a search in amazon . 
not sure- mine is jvm1339bw002 . i bet it does , but i would measure to make sure ! 
there are 2 screws that hold it on . one at the bottom and one at the top . one of the screws requires that you remove the inner `` trim ring '' which just snaps out . be careful to not over tighten as this handle is plastic and you could damage it . 
it has been months since i ordered mine . but i think the number your asking about is the same number mine was . an it did work . 
my shower is tiled and have not had any problems . it 's like a tension rod so maybe check the tension on it . 
yes , the bar can be used on either side 
i will work for books i would say not a heavy duty book shelf 
i do n't see why not , assuming you have researched the dimensions . good luck : - ) 
possibly but not easily . they are prepositioned 
this cabinet is pretty tall unless it 's a very large bathroom i do n't know if it will fit . 
i probably gave 30 lb each shelf using it for can good and spices 
unfortunately it does . 
to be honest i never paid it any attention . i was more focused on the softness 
i have n't found it to be hot when i sleep on it . 
sorry i do n't know what you mean . all i can say is these sheets are the best i 've ever had for my bed . 
our split king is 2 xl twin mattresses that are side by side but can move up and down separate from each other . 
the sheets fit our tempurpedic split remote bed . it should fit yours . 
yes , we have about 10 different colors . please click on our company 's name on the listing ( royal hotel bedding ) then click on royal hotel store front and search our items for all split-king sheets with color you desire and they should come up . 
i do n't know , but the sheets are nice , they are comfortable and soft . 
yes they work- we elevate the head of the bed to make putting the sheets on easier 
yes 
we use this pump on a coleman air mattress . works quite well . 
yes . use the vacuum end of the orifice to deflate a mattress . 
yes it works with 220 , i 've used it in the us and just plugged it in . 
maybe large one , it way too powerfull for the average size . 
no , only the attachments you see in the picture . 
yes it does .i purchased it for an intex queen size mattress 
no 
yes , but i 'd depends on the quantity 
18 '' x 18 '' 
just the case . it is zippered and fit easily over an existing pillow i had . it is really cute and worth the price . i love mine . 
i really do n't know . they are nicely made and the fabric is rather thick . i would guess they could be hand washed or washed in the gentle cycle . i would line-dry them & not risk throwing them in the dryer . 
not in my opinion ... fabric is thin , not much texture . 
thanks for your question , this product is sold by an independent seller on amazon.com and follows our 30 day return policy . amazon.com offer returns for most items within 30 days of receipt of shipment . you can check the seller 's policies here : 
it is dyed . 
they are made of plastic and the grey band around the glass is made of rubber . they do bounce as they have fallen out of the freezer . 
no they are n't . this would normally bother me but not in this case . i love these glasses . 
yes 
ca n't tell . i checked the packaging and all inserts . also tried finding info on the web , but had no luck . sorry . 
i 've had mine a few months . i wash them and put them right back in the freezer until i need them again . sometimes they are in the freezer for weeks between uses . so far no problems . 
i think one unless it states otherwise 
very much so . i have used mine over 50 times and i can tell you nothing sticks to it . the only thing you ca n't do is cut on it . 
made in china 
it 's about 1mm thick.it 's very strong . i love it ! 
dear i. hadianto , the mat is most effective when laid flat on a half sheet tray . the mat would still work but it does n't fold like paper does so a quarter sized mat would probably your best option . i hope this helps . kind regards , brightspring 
hi hanna , the mat is made in china . however this mat is made of the highest quality materials and our mats go through rigorous testing to ensure they meet our ( and our customers ' ) standards . these mats meet all necessary us regulations , and by using reputable and trusted manufacturers in china we are able to bring you a great quality product at an affordable price . i hope this helps with your enquiry . the brightspring team

one for ounces , none for grams milliliters . 
9.9 x 0.7 x 5.9 inches . 
it will stay on the setting it was on when it was last shut off . 
i do n't know . i have n't needed one yet . 
it does not . the cap unscrews and completely comes off and you drink as if from an ordinary cup . 
without the strainer or the cap it should be microwave safe . my bf has microwaved his but i 'm hesitant because i worry about the air gas pocket between the layers of glass . long story short it should be fine but a hot water kettle would be a better alternative than microwaving the water and just about as quick . 
metal . 
yes . 
yes . it comes on when you open the door and when in use . 
i took a quick measurement ~ 2 '' 
yes you can . see instruction manual page 12 . 
does it defrost meat evenly don , t no have not had it that long i have never seen a microwave defrost meat evenly . any of them . 
i had it up against a large cutting board next to my refrigerator and i had no issues . i did keep the side with the venting open and clear , which is on the left side if you are looking at the front of it . 
all of the latches have a screw on the side of the machine that holds the outer cover . the bottem screw on the right can be tightened too much making it difficult to close the door without making a loud snapping noise . there are two ways to solve the problem . the first is to loosen the screw about a half turn and the second is to press the release mechanism before closing the door which takes the pressure off of the latch completely as you close the door . care in using the door mechanism solves the problem . if you have difficulty closing or opening the door , loosen the screw until the door opens easily then tighten it a quarter turn . if you adhere to this procedure the door problem is eliminated . it is really a great microwave . 
not sure what the issue was mary but i have n't seen any trouble with mine since i got it . by the way it is the best microwave i have ever had ... love this one ! 
i bought it just in case , but it seems pretty solid out of the box . i probably would not buy warranty if i had the chance to do it again 
hard to measure exactly , but i 'd say 1 1 2 inches . i love mine ! it 's so very comfortable on top of my memory foam mattress . i 'm getting ready to order one for my king-size mattress as well . hope this helps . 
the one i have here is the bamboo one . it is stretchy , but not a nylon material . it fits a deep pocket mattress better though . my other bed is not as deep , and it fits a bit loose . it is fine with tight fitting sheets though . 
hi ! all of our sheets and mattress toppers fit up an 18 inch mattress ! if you have any other questions or concerns , please feel free to ask ! thank you ! -eluxurysupply customer service 
it might . i have a blow up mattress . and i know i ca n't put a fitted sheet on it but the pockets on this is made of stretchy material so it just may work . 
i think the 14 is the total amount of pieces including lids . as far as the sa , i do n't really know , maybe just part number or merchandise number or something like that . i do n't think it really says anything about the cookware . 
yes you can ! work great , heat up fast ! 
1qt. , 2 qt. , 3 qt . 
according to sam 's club they are manufactured in china . 
i do n't know , i do n't have a induction stove . but i like the pans a lot . 
i have been trying to find out - but unsuccessful so far ; i would not buy anything less than 18 10 . 
15 3 4 
it does have slide out sides to fit the window . they also accordion from the unit in case you have a smaller window . 
generous . about 5-6 feet . 
yes . it comes with the usual accordion type sides and screws and such . 
yes , a pleated quick mount window mounting kit included . 
hi sherry , this is not solid wood . i imagine a solid wood cabinet like this would be about $ 1200- $ 1500 . but this is not a junky cabinet either . it 's really good quality . believe me , i have had those cruddy ones before that have the finish peel off . this is much nicer than that and is really heavy duty . i liked the first one so well i bought a few more of these for my home and my office . good luck , jeff 
no the openings are 12 '' tall by 11 1 2 '' deep 
yes , they are installed near the end but there is no need to install them at all . 
model 414108 is in the salt oak finish and is more gray than brown but not very dark . these are the only two options that sauder has in this style . 
i 'm not sure on how big the canvas bins are , but the shelves are 15 1 2 '' wide and 11 1 2 '' deep and all will hold 25lbs . ( 50lbs on the very bottom shelf ) 
they are optional . 
no . i checked the manufacturer 's website . this collection only includes tv stands and bookcases . 
unfortunately there is no any type of guard comes with this slicer . but i like it anyway . 
no . it would be way too thin . actually i did n't even like it for julianne veggies . too thin ! 
i do not think it will work ... .surely you can just use a knife . it works so well for harder fruit and veg ... .celeriac or beetroot are a dream once grated with this 'machine ' 
i think that you can use it for hard cheese , but i think it is not a best stuff for this . i use it for carrots and this is really good . 
i would so soak it for about 1 min and a half before using it and then after a few passes with the knife i would do it for 30 seconds just to keep the stone wet and for a smoother pass with the knife 
both 
yes , i use oil on mine . would also suggest the 3000 5000 , to get your knives razor sharp . 
hi , this does n't come with a powerstrip , however any 6-outet will fit thanks 
yes ! i leave curling ons and stick it on there while it warms up . 
yes . 
hi ! the diameters are 2 3 4 inches for the big hole , and 2 1 4 inches for the two smaller holes . thanks 
unfortunately no , this item was not designed to be wall mountable . sorry ! 
yes , you can put the pot in the microwave , oven , or just about any place . best wishes . 
china 
yes with a metal rim . 
no , it does n't have a rubber seal , but works beautifully . this is the best slow cooker i 've ever had . 
yes , the insert is removable . it 's stoneware so it 's not light but not so heavy you ca n't deal with it . 
no it is a regular black ceramic type cooker . 
the lid is not hinged , the back of the cooker has a metal stand that you can rest the lid on . when not in use , it flips down and keeps the cord wound . 
13 '' front to back , 12 '' side to side , 8 '' tall ... ... ... .love them . have countless of the medium and small ... .organized my pantry ! 
definitely . i attached mine to a wooden board and put fruit and veggies in them so i think just the wall would be fine . 
no , the top of the box is slightly wider than the bottom so they would not easier stack . 
china 
no , it 's more square , i use it to hold my kitchen towels . 
no . 
pretty sure they are 12 x12 x8 inches tall ( nice basket ) 
it is 7.75 '' h x 12 '' w x 13 '' d 
the interior of the popper is stainless steel . the hood is plastic . the popped corn momentarily ricochets off the hood as it leaves the popper and goes into your bowl . i hope this helps . 
yes 
the hot air blows from vents on the sides , all the way around the unit . it works well , worth every $ . 
the t in the word t-fal means teflon 
you turn it off when all kernels are thru popping . it makes enough to serve 2 or 3 . 
turn it off when popcorn stops coming out . the top is solid black and gets very hot . 
i do n't have an answer for this question . you might have to do some research . 
okay . i 'm not an idiot . i did not call anyone a name i simply asked a question to a question to me . and since i have never , ever drunk a single drop of coffee , and never will , asking the question was a genuine curiosity . and frankly , i buy the right appliance for the right purpose . while i am creative , i would never have thought of anything coffee related . 
i have no idea ! we purchased it as a gift , to use as described-to pop , popcorn ! 
yes of course , you can use a small lime and it does not have to be big citrus . its inner diameter is about 2.5 inch and if citrus is too big , you can always cut in half and use . any further questions , please feel free to contact us . 
this works great for fruits smaller than 3 inches in diameter , so definitely lemons and limes and smaller oranges . i originally purchased this for blood oranges , and it works great for those . most oranges are going to be larger than 3 inches in diameter , though , and wo n't physically fit in this juicer without hanging out the sides . 
china 
absolutely not . i have weaker hands every day ( 50+ women can probably relate ) and i was shocked at how little effort this takes ! you truly hardly touch it and the juice comes pouring out . 
it 's rolled & comfortable . no sharp edges to cut yourself on thankfully . 
yes 
yes . i have n't used the covers much , but i have them , and i checked one , and it seems very tight . maybe even turn it upside down tight . 
hi , there are some inaccurate responses to this question . the lids are in fact bpa free just like the entire vonshef range . many thanks , designer habitat 
if you really wanted to , you could retrofit the window with plywood , but it would n't be pretty . 
about 5 ft . 
yes . 
yes ! it will fit up to a 36 '' wide window 
it does n't come with a sleeve that i could see . 
yes 
i measured my unit and it is 19 '' wide by 12 '' tall so in my opinion it would not fit . the 19 '' is just the unit leaving no room on either side also . i hope this helps ! 
i do n't live in a mobile home but the house i 'm in is not insulated well and it cools a good size room just fine . 
bump 
60 degrees 
the straw is 9 inches long . 
no . there is just a hole in the lid for the straw 
no , not at all . i have the black and plain and i love them ! 
unfortunately , in china 
absolutely not 
from the web i learned it is made in china . 
no it is not ! i was scared to use it on my glass stove top . i boil it and then put boiling water in the pot ! 
dear tea lover , surely you can use it in microwave . all our tea-wares are made of heat resistant glass , which means the glass alone can handle temperature shock . you can take the teapot out of refrigerator ( cooler part ) and pour boiling water in . it wont break the teapot ... ; ) let me know if any other questions you have 
just about 3 coffee cups sizes . i have mine on a warmer the whole time so i ca n't answer how long it keeps tea warm exactly . sorry . but i really like this teapot and i would recommend getting it 
c'mon people ... this person is n't asking if it is going to mop their ceilings ! i believe the gps signal for these mops works by transmitting from the cube and bouncing off the ceiling to the mopping unit . so , my question too is if you have very high cathedral ceilings , will this appliance work properly to mop the entire floor area ? 
the power charger adapter accepts 100-240v 50 60hz power supply . thus , you can safely plug the charger into your wall socket using the appropriate socket converter to adapt the 2-pin usa plug into whatever pin arrangement in use in your country . i used it in singapore ( 220-240v ) and it worked perfectly . 
hi , yes the cloths are machine washable in warm or hot water . they can be air dried or put in dryer . no bleach or fabric softener . hope this answers your q . 
you need to remember that it is pushing anything on the floor around and not picking or sucking it up as a vacuum would . the microfiber cloth works well as a dust cloth and picks up some of the hair . i would suggest that you vacuum if you truly want your floor free of debris . i have found that the robot works best as a wet mop 
i move one cube from upstairs to downstairs and it works just fine . 
any microfiber will do that is cut to size . the cost of the irobot microfiber cloth is not terrible , and you get cloths that are absolutely perfect , after all , for the machine ! 
i think i would work great as long as there are n't deep grout lines . it cleans the tile in my baths having very smooth tile and almost even grout lines wonderfully . 
is made out of acrylic 
just under 11 '' 
it 's the size of a regular cake plate doom 
all most 2 '' cubes 
4 ounces for one cube . 24 ounces for the whole tray . 
yes , they stack nicely in the freezer . great ice cube trays , love them ! 
i have no idea , peter . i would think the silicone formulaused to manufacture these ice trays could be the same similar to manufacture the baking cups used for cupcakes and other kindred baking products . however , err on the side of caution when considering to expose this product to high temperatures , as in an oven . better to use this product for the purpose intended , unless you can obtain some definitive advice from the manufacturer . hope this helps a little . good luck and happy new year . 
i 'm sorry , paula , but i have no idea . i do love them , and plan to buy more . good luck . louise . 
no they are about 1.4 x 1.4. they are awesome 
1.9 x 1.9 
hello angela - if you are buying it from dreamscape furniture , it is included along with free shipping : ) thank you - scott 
yes 
yes 
no . xl stands for `` extra long '' . twin xl is 5 inches longer than a regular twin . this bed fits a regular twin mattress pretty snugly . 
the drawers are 16 '' deep , so they pull out about 14 '' . 
this comes with the twin sheet set 
we wash ours in the dishwasher with no problem 
no , but they 're great quality . 
wish there was and a dust ruffle , not to mention post sheers . 
i have my old canopy bef from when i was a child ( about 30 years ago ) . it looks pretty similar to the bed in the advertisement picture but is wooden painted white . 
it would look a bit better on a canopy bed with an arch . ours did n't come with one and it still looks nice but a little saggy . i think it would work for most canopy beds . it has holes on each corner so you just slip it on . super easy . 
yes i am currently using them 
we 've had ours 6 plus months . no sign of rust . it 's stainless steel . not sure how it would rust . 
i have done that and it does retain a good amount of its carbonation . mind you it 's not going to be as carbonated as it was at first but it 's still pretty good . i also kept mine in the refrigerator for the time being which will help it remain carbonated . 
no it does not come with cartridges . the cartridge holder has long threads which i expect accommodate any standard 8 gram cartridge , though i have only used leylands . the leyland cartridges on amazon are by far the cheapest i have found , esp . when bought in bulk . 
21 oz is liquid volume . each tea has different kind texture . example some teas are kinda whole leaves such as ceylan tea , green tea . some of them has very small leaves such as turkish tea . so the weight of the tea will be depend of the leaves . if your tea has big leaves it may hold less than 5 oz , if the leaves are small you can go up to 7-8 oz . there is a easy way to understand how much this tins will hold though . do you have any measurement cup with fl oz written on it . find the 21 oz and fill to that line your tea . this tin will hold exactly that much tea . 
sorry - we do not . 
near as i can tell , they are made of tin , as stated in the product description . 
approximately 21 oz . 
i would say around 60 lbs . i 'm a small stature person and had a hard time carrying into my house . 
it 's off white -- almost a bone color . 
ceramic 
its says 25 pounds at the description.. but the true is 54 pounds ! ! ! ! ! 
when we placed our set next to a white serving dish , our set looked off white almost egg shell in color . not bright white . hope this helps ! 
it 's probably on the heavier side . 
no 
nope ! not at all 
while any dish ware not metal nor plastic can break and not totally indestructible , this ironware is the least likely and extremely durable , considering . also most high end looking set for what it is ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . 
you can order all sizes and ( 5 '' or 10 '' thick ) from their website : https : www.tuftandneedle.com you can directly order from their website ( same free shipping and return policies ) 
i contacted tuft & needle about the bed frame displayed on their website to see if it was available for purchase . kelly responded and advised that the frame was a prototype and not available at this time . she gave me the web addresses to couple of companies that make similar frames : haikudesigns.com and tatamiroom.com . the frames from those two companies were out of my price range , but they all look very nice . i found a basic solid mahogany platform bed frame from the charles p. rogers website that i am going to buy . i 've never heard of the company , but all the reviews mention that their product is very high quality . this is the bed frame i am going to purchase : http : www.charlesprogers.com solide-platform-bed-p-392.html ? cpath=31_155 one thing i like about this frame is that the platform is level with the frame and appears to be some kind of upholstered deck instead of wooden slats . 
hey ! i use luna premium hypoallergenic 100 % waterproof mattress protector - 10 year warranty - made in the usa - and love it . wash it when you first open it ( like most things wrapped in plastic - yuck ! ) and then it 's great . about once a month to six weeks i take it off and wash it , too . no bleach , medium-low on the dryer . http : www.amazon.com gp product b002aqnxr4 ref=cm_cd_asin_lnk 
firmer , but this is not a memory foam mattress . it 's similar to a futon mattress . 
any mattress covers do not come with the mattress . i use a mattress protector on the mattress , then use a fitted sheet on the top , so that i do not leave any stains on the mattress ! 
i ca n't remember exactly , but it 's about 1.5'x1.5x5 . ' it 's vacuum sealed and needs a couple of hours before you sleep on it to expand . 
i asked the same question and was told normal sheets -- - it 's true ! fitted sheets fit right on like a mattress , so if you order a full size t & n bed , use full sheets . 
mine arrived in a package that was about as long as the mattress was wide , and was maybe 12-18 inches square in profile . they vacuum pack the mattress and it takes up a lot less space than you would expect . it is packed about like a giant poster . 
only if the flip top is removed . this could be done , but it be a time consuming task . i think that a bottle drying tree might be easier . 
yes . each rack holds 24 , 1 ounce bottles . 
no , but you do n't really need one . just put it on your bed and put the sheets over it and it 's fine 
ours has sunk , leaving a mountain in the middle . wo n't be buying a second one . 
fairly dense but it is more comfortable than just the firm mattress we have . 
we 've only had it a couple of months and seems fine . it will shift on bed a little but i need a new mattress protector which goes over gel topper . and my spouse and i are not small people . i 've been happy with it as has my lower back . 
it 's plenty firm for us . we put it in our travel trailer however been thinking about trading it out for the one on the bed in house because it is so very comfortable . luv this topper , best one we 've had 
just the foam 
it 's pretty dense . cumbersome to put on the bed by yourself ; pretty easy with 2 people though . not sure of exact weight . 
no , not that i know of 
yes , this item will shut off automatically when the water runs out . so it could be used in night and you do n't need to worry about it . 
no 
its 5 1 2 in high and 3 wide at the bottom ... good unit but do really make any difference when its on at night . my friend told me he wakes up feeling good when its on but not for me . my bedroom may be too big for it . give it a try if you want . 
it depends on the quality and concentration of the oil . it also depends on your own taste ; if you like a smooth or strong aroma . in average i use about 20 drops per full charge ( 500ml ) of top quality essential oil . i hope you 'll find this useful 
no 
the mist is immediate . 
no 
it 's about 8 hours . : ) 
the inside diameter of cup is 3 inches . the height is 3 and 13 16ths of an inch . and holds a little over a pint of liquid . 
yes . 
hello vincent - china . best wishes - mike 
no , it is not . 
about 30 lbs . it moves easily . 
it is a little noisy but not loud . 
yes , it has a timer . 
holds 63 pints of water 
no , it says in the manual hard water usually is n't a problem . i have well water and it 's not a problem . 
if all you need is a fan , just use a fan instead . 
it take time to do it in regards to cleaning it maybe under 15 minutes total of work aside from cleaning it . i have yet to replace mine but it should take the same amount of time . 
i use mine at night for the cooler air while sleeping . it usually lasts 2 full nights . 
it is stainless steel 
yes , this information is correct . 
yes , you can do that 
i think it will be hard to clean , like most coffemakers . i guess the filter that it has might help with hard water . 
i order them through amazon . 
yes you can , with just one tea spoon of oil added on top . 
you 'll be surprised at how juicy the chicken turns out when cooked in this air fryer . it 's fairly easy to prepare and best of all healthy without losing its tastiness . 
dry foods that come as frozen : for example i spray my frozen french fries with butter and add some salt , and they come out to taste great ! i love eating raw broccoli and spray it with some olive oil : ) kids frozen nuggets are to oily so i just placed them like that 
about 12 pounds 
yes you can . wings and thighs are wonderful cooked in the fryer . the skin is crisp and the meat is juicy . i have n't tried cooking a breast so ca n't rate it 's performance there . 
its not much concept wise ... this definitely cooks much better than a convection oven though ... it takes a little trial and error to cook things in the flip other than chicken strips and fries but when ya get it right its awesome ... one of my favorite purchases recently 
hot air while the meat or food product sits on a wire mesh . there 's no oil and the heat from the air cooks the product through and through . 
i really do n't know those specs rather than to say it plugs into a regular wall socket . hope that helps . 
no , standard 12 oz beer bottle is too long to fit in bin . 
this container will hold approximately 9 bottles easily . stacked 5 deep on bottom layer and 4 on the top . the bin however , can not be stacked with another unit . the top layer of bottles protrudes above the side guide rails and they are not designed to be stacked with another unit . 
it 's in product description as 13 '' w x 12'l . however , they neglect to mention that the space between shelves is about 4 1 4 inches . also , and most important , the product in the photo is very misleading . the shelves are actually bigger and did not fit in my ( not mine , landlord 's ) hotpoint top freezer . however , they fit in the bottom fridge and help containing my yogurt containers and biscuit cans . ps : not made for heavy stuff . 
hello , i did not purchase this particular product . i purchased the wine and the soda bottle version . they do have room between the bottles and the bottom of the holder that was stacked . but not sure about this one . sorry . 
16 ounce water bottles fit perfect . love it . 
a 20 ounce gatorade and or an 18 ounce poland spring bottle will fit with ease . 
yes it does . i have smaller water bottles in it right now ( 8 oz ) and just tried an 8 oz coke bottle - i stack these lengthwise , however , and it holds up to 24 of the 8 oz bottles . it also holds the larger water and soda bottles , but i stack those width-wise , which is what i usually use . what i like best about this bin is that the bottles are neatly stacked and , of course , are never toppling over as before when i tried to stand them on the refrigerator shelves . i am considering getting another one for my v8 juice . 
scroll down the page to : product dimensions : 11.5 x 19 x 71.2 inches ; 49 pounds 
71.25 inches tall , 11.5 inches deep , and 19 inches wide . 
as stated in the product description , the width is 19 inches ( outside dimension ) . 
no spices , just jars and the carousel . 
no 
no spices , just lidded jars and the carousel . 
nothing significant , but despite it 's size you wo n't get two mugs worth . less is not always more . 
no . the filter basket assembly is partly plastic with a very fine metal mesh . the seal on the press feels like silicone . other than discoloration , i have not had any problems with it or think it is deteriorating in any way . 
those figures are correct . it is 18 ounces and actually 32 ounces . 
it 's a canadian company . 
yes ! 
just a few more data points . the medium has two lines the lower is just under 20oz ( about 19 oz ) and the upper is 24oz . it 's about 30oz all the way to the top ( where the seam between the inner and outer are welded ) . ( measured by weight with no grinds nor filter . ) note that this does n't seem to match the faq ( http : espro.ca faq-espro-press ) which notes 600ml 450ml ( 20.2oz 15.2oz ) for the upper lower marks . i presume the difference is assuming the grinds take up a volume of ~4oz . 
the tank holds 1 gallon . i use filtered water , and so did not install the provided filter ( which uses up some of the volume ) . 
yes , ac 100v-240v 50-60hz adapter changes voltages to 24vdc in order to operate the humidifier . 
first and foremost i think you need to read the manual that came with the humidifier.you 'll definitely need the ezcal cleaner descaler packets , and hydro cells , water maintenance system . the last item you need is an ag+ ionic silver demineralization cartridge . read and follow all the instructions . 
i believe it is three years . m . 
i have never tried that and have not noticed any label indicating dishwasher safety . i use simple green spray , then rinse well with water . 
i would use the ezcal . it 's a great humidifier if you buy it you wo n't be disappointed . 
china 
ice chamber is plastic , the rest of it is glass . we made a mixed drink in it and the glass was so thin it broke it a perfect circle when we were stirring the drink with a plastic spoon . not sure whether we had one defective product or if it 's an overall issue , but would not recommend the product . 
its plastic 
yes it is removable . you can use the jar with or without it . one piece of advice . make sure if when you get this to tighten the spigot valve from inside the jar . i am very happy with this purchase . 
it is a threaded lid . i liked it a lot . i used it to make sangria . my only admonishment is to make sure that the screw behind the spigot is tightened . mine came loose which i did not find out until the sangria was in . i had to pour it out tighten the spigot and pour the sangria back in . after that it worked perfectly . 
you sure can ! 
depends on the refrig and rack adjustment . its taller than a milk bottle . 
container is glass , lid and inside ice tube are plastic . really good for the price . has lasted me 6 uses so far with no leaking . 
yes ! they work on my 650 . 
no screws were included . just remove the olde brush ( screw in center of brush ) , put the new brush on with the existing screw . 
i would say generic knock-off , although the term sounds more derogatory than necessary . they came six in a clear plastic bag , with no brand labeling . however , i have found them to be completely compatible , and totally satisfactory . no quality issues , in my experience . 
it fits the 650. does your brush look like that one ? 
yes they fit fine 
the seller 's answer is inaccurate . there is less than two inches between the slats ( where the mattress rests on ) and the top of the sideboard . in other words , the frame conceals only 2 inches of the mattress . 
i do n't think it will . 
no 
no . there is no odor . 
yes 
bottom center of the base . 
the trays are plastic ! ! ! box does n't say if it is bpa free or not . 
sorry - i do n't know because it was a gift but i can find out after 12 25 . 
china 
definitely ! we actually bought this specifically to do jerky of all varieties . 
yes 
no it is pure silicone . 
there is no fiberglass . 
hi mary , the heads of the spatula 's are 100 % pure fda approved , food grade silicone . the handles are plastic . hope this answers your question . 
kitchen starz silicone muffin pans clean up perfectly in the dishwasher with no spotting . 
the muffin pans are 100 % pure food grade silicone . absolutely no fillers ! 
the diameter is 2 3 4 '' at the top and 2 1 8 '' at the bottom . the muffin pans make standard size muffins . 
the dimensions are 2 3 4 '' diameter and 1.2 '' deep . standard muffin pan size 
hi james ! the muffin pans are standard size . 
we have n't tried making smoothies with our vrt400 . it is primarily a juice extractor and it does a great job of that . no matter what fruit or vegetable you put into it , it squeezes the juice out and leaves all the fibre and pulp behind . my opinion is that you would want to use a blender to make smoothies , not a juicer . 
no , the warranty is valid when purchasing from any authorized dealer ( like us ! ) . to order please use this link : http : www.amazon.com omega-vertical-masticating-juicer-vrt400 dp b00ciu8xyk ref=sr_1_14 ? m=aycjzs8twa85p & s=merchant-items & ie=utf8 & qid=1370465375 & sr=1-14 thanks , mike . coolshinystuff 
there is a removable rubber seal that keeps the tap closed . it is hinged and can be left open as well . 
yes , there is only one model . sometimes the `` hds '' is not included in the name for convenience . 
yes and yes . this is not a secret . it 's a well known fact that this juicer ejects pulps into the juice ( just google it ) . what 's not clear and hard to define is the amount and the size of pulps because it depends on the greens . also , the personal tolerance or preference to pulps is different . some people claim that they like the pulps in their juices but that 's kind of absurd . one of the important reasons that we make juices over blending is that it 's pulp free , fiber free , and easily drinkable so that the body can absorb nutritions faster . i 'd tell people that to make blending instead if they like pulps , which i do in the morning to get extra fibers . to make comparisons to other juicers that i have used , breville and omeage 8006 do not eject any pulps to the juice . if i may add , nothing tastes better than smooth , silky , fresh , delicious juices ! 
it is available in the 220 volt model and that will be $ 15 to $ 20 more for that model . you will have to order that model and not the 110 one . 
korea 
15 years ! ! ! you can check the website . as i understand it , some juicers shipped with paper work indicating a 10 year warranty , but even those are covered by the newer , 15 year warranty .

yes , it is smaller than most recliners and you slide a little because it does n't recline back far enough . 
its real leather wrapped around foam cushions just like a couch . 
yes there are a couple of massage motors in the leg rest . 
both the outer shell and inner fill are 100 % polyester.the cover is made in china and the product is filled and finished in the usa . 
this is approx 15 - 15 1 2 inches tall . 
john -- -i really dont know -- -however -- -my guess is that it is the cording that brings the edges of the material together -- -- -it is much fatter -- heavier than the usual cording you see -- if you know someone who sews , they can show you -- -it 's all over the place , on pillows , cushions etc . actually it makes this item at least seem -- very substantial . google up `` cording on pillows '' ===see what you get -- good luck ! 
i do n't know the width . i bought it for my nephew , and he not a small man . he said it was very comfortable . 
it 's 18 inches high , very plush , and comfortable . 
18 inches 
better ask mfg but i remember reading that you should not even fold them or fibers may break . i would n't count on it . maybe they make different sizes . 
mine came rolled up in a bag . i store them that way , too -- rolled without the bag . saves a ton of space and makes them easy to get out . 
i do n't change any temp settings using these mats for anything i do ! they work great . i want to use them with my induction cooktop but have n't gotten any answers from chico chef if that works 
i wash mine by hand . they clean up very easily and nicely without a dishwasher . not sure if they can be put in dishwasher . 
i 'm not sure what you problem might be . i have a convection oven and place my silicone mats on top of my double-layered cookie sheet . the only adjustment i 've had to make is to cook the cookies 3-4 min longer than normal . my daughter has a standard oven and has n't reported any problem with hers . i know that with my old oven i had to buy a thermometer for inside as the electrical power in our neighborhood fluctuated terribly ... sometimes 175 degrees hotter and sometimes almost that amount under ... 
since you can not cut the baking mats , i use them to keep food from sticking on baking stones and baking sheets , in which they will fit . a good replacement for parchment paper or greasing pans . have n't tried them with cakes , brownies or casserole since they do n't fit in those pans 
they are pretty thin , about the width of twenty pieces of computer paper . they are awesome and i definitely recommend them to anyone that does any cooking at all . well worth the price ! 
yes . 100 % silicone . no fillers . -- kitchie 
i have used them just sitting on a cookie sheet and the result was excellent . i do n't know that it would be appropriate to put into a muffin tin . 
these are the same size as the cupcake papers you can get in any grocery store . 
it 's made in china 
800 
no it is fixed , 
medium thickness , 1.25 inches . not deep waffles , but not eggo style either 
8 1 2 inches 
china 
i do not know . i returned it because mine did not cook evenly . 
it takes 1 cup of batter . i love my waffle maker . it does tend to run hot so you would probably like setting number 2. that is where i have determined that mine needs to be set . hope you enjoy yours as much as we do mine . 
the directions in the manual say 1 cup 
absolutely , i 've never had an issue ( top rack ) . 
no . i have 4 and i 've never had that happen . 
according to their main website , it says it is made with american materials . i do believe the product is from oakville , ontario canada . 
`` juice in the boxes are made with highly durable tritan , a food safe , bpa and phalate-free material ``

shelves are pretty sturdy and can hold quite a bit , however as a whole the structure is n't . almost broke it carrying out of the apartment when moving out as it 's it 's susceptible to being twisted arc when held from both ends . 
i had to look them up online . but they refused to replace the part that was damaged 
the shelves are about 10 3 4 inches each . hope this helps . 
product dimensions : 43.4 x 11.5 x 75.5 inches ; 81 pounds 
the shelves are adjustable after assemble . they are not locked into place for good . i have and do adjust my shelves as i need to . i really love my unit . i bought two additional units so far myself . wonderful product . 
13 '' x 30 '' 
instructions are not included . pretty easy though . put the plastic bushings around the poles where you think you want them , starting with the bottom shelf . lightly grip each bushing and slowly pull up and down till you feel them click into place . once you have all four bushings set for a shelf , firmly push the shelf down onto them . 
sorry i do n't know as mine came without any directions or paperwork . 
30 '' w x 14 '' d x 63 '' h ( or 59 '' h without the wheels installed ) 
exactly what the amazon product drescription states . 
they are not on the smaller sizes . there is one larger model with removable and dishwasher safe grids griddle . for the smaller size i find it easiest to rinse the grills over the sink with the dish sprayer then to wipe it down with paper towel or dry kitchen towel . do not do this with the grill plugged into an electrical outlet . 
the box says china . 
i 've put frozen burgers on it and it worked fine but i have n't tried any other frozen meats in it . 
you can barely fit two burgers , or one piece of chicken breast . thats all it will fit . 
cleaning up after burgers : my method is to take a few folded paper towels and wet them and clean the grill while it 's still warm . all the grease runs into the drip tray while cooking so you just want to get the hard stuff off the grids . after it cools down , i clean it again with wet paper towels and it 's good to go . if you prefer , you can add some dish soap to the paper towels but remember to follow up with wet paper towels or a sponge to get all the soap off . 
no , it does not . it is a small enough grill that you can check on what you are grilling for the stage you want . i have used it for `` chicken '' appetizers , fish - be sure you oil and season the fillet or steak . it also used it to heat frozen waffles and grilled sandwiches . for the short time the grill is working you can stay with it as the grill master .

no 
could be made at any place with george foreman specification and warranty , just like i phone , nike and many other brand and products ... now , components of product are made worldwide , assembly and manufacturing at one place . 
mine did n't ... but it comes clean so easily i really have n't needed one ... 
61 lbs 
well , it 's 4 1 2 inches from the accordion panel to the front . so , if you look up the dimensions from front to back , subtract 4.5 inches and that should give you an approx . length to the back of it . 
short answer : not really for normal sleeper- long reply- noise level from fan speeds during operation is better than other unit 's i 've tried over the years , including previous 10k btu lg wall unit . bought two lg 10k units to replace a 13k heat cool sears unit in main living area of cabin and cut a c bill by 50 % . noise issue , when both lg units quit operating ( br still runs but thermostat is off ) . lady friend who can go to sleep with tv sound volume up does not get disturbed by this a c ( on in other room ) when she 's in town . i 'm a light sleeper and the frigidaire does n't wake me up despite the slight noise when trying to get to sleep ( noting again this frigidaire is in the main living area ( next room divided by wall and door , a c location is 25 ' from headboard in the bedroom ( bedroom a c is an lg which is a little noisier and left off unless deep into a hot n humid florida summer . the frigidaire wall banger in question is quieter . there is a light 'thump ' heard from compressor cycling on off which is normal for wall units . the main issue with this a c is the thermostat is not even close to actual temp , needing to be set 4 degrees lower and sometimes changed as the unit does n't shut off like it should on energy efficient setting ( nice for fan not to run full time like sears unit ) . note : this is annoying and if buying again would purchase the 10k btu lg unit instead of this unit . not enough difference in noise to overcome other issues . some folks i know , claim the samsung wall units are quiet but this is second hand , not first hand info from ... . davzway 
no . it automatically drips to the outside . 
i have model # ffre1033q1 . the amp draw is 7.7 in cooling mode . eer rating is 11.3. you can go to the frigidaire web site to get the complete specs . there are several 10000 btu models . the one you are looking for is the model number i indicated above . ac units are listed under home comfort . you can also down load the manual . 
yes it will . 
the manual has cleaning instructions using white vinegar but too many steps for this venue . suggest you either go to the manufacture 's web site or call them for detailed instructions . it 's a simple process just too much to type here . 
if you purchase ground coffee ( as i do ) there will be some sediment in the bottom of the carafe . you can go to http : icoffee.com component hikashop product listing ? itemid=108 and order a basket filter at no charge if your coffeemaker did n't come with one . remington must have realized this issue and designed a fix . i use the basket filter and it works well at removing the sediment . 
dear kaye , fresh , medium coarse to coarsely ground coffee is recommended for best results . diane customer care 
all except the container pot and warming plate . ca n't say about internals . this is made the same as most any wal mart target brand ( it has the remington brand name on the base ) only it has the swirl function . the strainer filter is metal but not big whoop there . again , if want to save yourself a $ 100.00 go but a upscale mr. coffee and forget all the hype around icoffee . 
yes it does . after 2 hours 
yes , i usually make only 2-4 cups . i just had to learn to adjust the amount of course ground coffee instead of finely ground . 
yes ... when not brewing , press the `` minutes music '' button..second touch should see on off selection ... 
the elites model . i have used both . the elite results in a much better texture so happy you are coming . sent from my iphone . 
you do n't have to use bananas - if you do n't it 's more like making a sorbet . bananas give it the creamy texture closer to ice cream , but you can you use basically whatever you want . i use it without bananas all the time . 
i have n't tried any of that , but i did look through the book , nothing was mentioned . when you use the fruit you need to let it set out for 12 min . to get to the right consistency , so i do n't think a liquid would work . they do use liquids to pour over it after its finished , like rum . i hope this helps , its really a great item . 
it sounds like a blender crunching frozen fruit when it 's running but it does n't take long for the fruit to go through . 
fruit is used as you would naturally eat them . the bananas are frozen without the peel . berries are frozen whole . pineapple without the shell , etc 
no only 120v 60hz you will need a transformer for uk etc 
i poured the pellets into a similarly sized cloth bag as the final piece . 
these beads are about 1 4 '' ( one quarter of an inch ) in diameter , and are all uniform in size . i really do n't know about the size of the beads in your snowglobe . i hope this helped . 
teenage is an age , not a size ... that 's relative at best ... it 's probably 4 or 5 bags to fill the average size bag that you would purchase from the store . you 'd be better off buying a bag from target , dumping it out , and putting it in your teenage bag .

hello , no we are not related to starbucks store any how , moreover , this tumbler from last christmas collection so its discontinued . this item is fullfilled by amazon , so you will get it very quickly , it will be shipped from the closest amazon warehosue 
no defects , brand new condition . 
standard insulated starbucks tumbler i have no idea if it is linned inside the walls sorry 
i believe it was bubble wrapped , but i honestly ca n't remember . sorry , it was awhile ago . but it was in perfect condition . hope this helps . 
i have not had a problem with them on a high setting . 
it does not say on the label so i do n't think so . 
yes , but there are some things to keep in mind . this mat is made if flexible silicone so there will be some slight sagging between the bars of your oven rack . something relatively stable like a pizza would be unaffected , but more delicate items like macarons would be very affected . also keep in mind that with a flexible sheet it might difficult to remove many items ( like 24 cookies ) before they have cooled for a bit . 
i do n't know , but i suspect it 's not made in the us . 
hard to estimate , but i would say similar to thickness of like card stock . thinner than card board . hope that helps ! 
yes it is and it works much better than the one it came with . i use this one in my oven and on my bbq pit . i have the chefalarm by thermoworks 
i think yes . read the full description of the dot thermometer . your answer is there . 
no . i ca n't think of a single reason why you 'd want to , tho 
the instant read probe will not . the high heat probe will fit through a 1 4 inch hole . 
yes . 
yes but put the wire thru the hole at the side of the bbq ... . do n't clamp the wire down with the bbq lid . there should be a natural hole created by the lid and base of the bbq when the lid is closed . for tri-tip roasts i do leave the probe in . i do n't normally leave the wire probe in for stakes.. when i am ready to test each steak , i just scoot the steak over to the far front of the grill and insert the probe into the side in the middle to get the temp . i am usually cooking several filet or other steaks at the same time so i test each steak one at a time . 
the packaging says it will only work with the chefalarm . 
the distance is 3 '' from drip spouts when inserted for function , but i used one 3 1 2 '' cup for double shot ( tip it a fraction when function complete , as you view pic , the drip spouts are 1 3 '' ) ... this is an excellent machine ! 0 problems in 18 mos . since purchase ! hope answer makes since ! great machine & white is hard to find ! 
i just tried . it does not fit a normal mug . this is an espresso machine and is designed for espresso cups . great machine . 
it 's an amazing unit , i 've used everyday for over a year , but , i do n't know the answer to your question ... ca n't you just get a connverter ? 
as shown on the picture , the clrearance between filter and cup tray is 3 inches . jocelyne

no , this is intended to be used in conjunction with a liner . thanks !

not sure of exact weight but it is not heavy by any means 
i have no idea about the difference but mine leaks horribly . 
i have used these popsicle molds to make healthy juice popsicles , yogart and fat free pudding pops and yes i think my mom would approve 
there 's no indication on the box or the product where it was made . 
the popsicles would be 2 3 8 wide , length is 3 3 4 when taken out of the mold . the tip of the mold has a 1 4 in more in length to insert into the stand . 
they sent us an email with the ebook a few days after we received the molds in the mail . 
4 containers and 4 lids 
no - they have plastic rims and clasps , so the lids can not go in the oven ! the bottoms can though 
clear ( translucent ) with a light blue rim 
i never use the lid as a cover in the microwave , even loosened . i think it would damage the rubber seals . 
according to the amazon webpage they are . i have n't washed them in my dishwasher . 
i have no idea . they say made in korea . microwave safe , oven safe , not stove top safe . i like them , they work for me . 
& lt ; & lt ; rectangular & gt ; & gt ; 1-3.5 cups 828 ml , 1-1.6 cups 378 ml & lt ; & lt ; round & gt ; & gt ; 1-1.6 cups 378 ml , 1-0.73 cups 173 ml 
recommended is 150 lbs for the top bunk and 200 lbs for the bottom . bunky boards can be added to increase the weight limit . adding extra slats can increase the weight as well . 
yes you can ! 
they look identical at first . and they have same hight from the floor and the same length . however , after measuring we found out that the lower bed has a bit ( 3-4 inches ) shorter legs and bit longer upper part than the bed which is up . thus , the producer enhanced space between beds for the convenience of the person who sleeps down . 
the paint covers up the grain . i assume it 's a hardwood of some kind . it seems very solid and does not indent easily like pine . 
yes , the ladder is removable . 
the ladder is on the right side only . 
yes , it is very solid and safe . 
no 
looking from the end of the blades , they are curved . 
the guarantee of a factory refurbished item is the same as a new item . there is no change in guarantees between a factory refurbished item and a new item . 
yes . you can shut off the grind function on the front panel . 
refurbished unit do not come with a filter . you have to order it separate . 
yes they can be sharpened but i have not had to do anything to them yet except wash them . they are still very very sharp . 
the guards are solid color ... same color as the knife 's handle 
by the balance and the weight i would say yes they do . it is an easy grip but firm . 
amazingly sharp . 
is shiny like a mirror 
ok 
i have no idea ... : - ) . in my experience , blender blades seem to be almost universal in size functionality ( regardless of brand ) you may want to google it , contact your neighborhood appliance repair shop or contact oster at 1-800-334-0759 or www.oster.com . good luck ! 
they are serrated .

three inches approximately , the removedcore is about one inch . 
yes it is dishwasher safe . i am learning you need to make sure the pineapple is all the way off of it before washing it or it comes out with a piece if pineapple still on it . washed it in the dishwasher several times no problems . 
i have used it on various sizes and have found it works well on all of them . the only thing you have to watch is to make sure you do n't core too far through the base of the pineapple . it is an excellent product . 
yes but it 's pretty self explanatory 
you do n't cut all the way thru the bottom . when you get down to the bottom you move the handle and shaft around gently as you pull up on the handle and it finally comes out in one piece . the core is left in the pineapple . our horses love the remains . 
china 
unknown , not indicated on box or on the actual product . go for it , seems well made and works well . 
43 '' l. 31 '' h. 15 '' w 
yes . it could hold 2 
yes 
width : 43 3 8 '' , depth : 15 3 4 '' , height : 30 5 8 '' 
the unit is sturdier than it looks , but i would limit the weight on the shelf behind the double door to 50 pounds . the base shelf has more support and could handle at least 100 pounds . 
you ca n't remove it after its built . so if you know you do n't want it in , just do n't add it when putting it together . it 's not adjustable when it 's all together . 
hidden 
no it doesnt have wheels or panels that match either . i bought it hated it . tried to return it , nada . 
hello , it is the white panel in back , thanks . 
the product dimensions in the listing look pretty accurate , dont have mine at hy house , it at my work office , but that looks right . product dimensions : 16 x 15 x 18.5 inches ; 31 pounds 
yes , tihs is a very safe product and looks great too . it is also likely the best one at heating a large room because it can continuously pull 1400w on the high setting , putting out more heat compared to smaller ones and ceramic electric heaters that only really draw about 800w . they may all be rated at `` 1500w '' but none of them really draw that much when warm . having more elements gives it more heating surface area to dissapate heat , which allows it to pull more power all the time . there are also low and eco settings so it does n't draw the 1400w if you do n't need the extra heat . because it does draw more power than other units you have to be more conscious of what else is on that circuit so you do n't trip the breaker . if you have 15-amp breakers , then this thing will be drawing about 12 amps , so you cant also run a vacuum cleaner on that circuit or a refrigerator or microwave or other large device . this is advertised as 1800w in places , but in the owners manual it says 1500w . however , in the same owners manual it says it may draw up to 15 amps , which would indeed be 1800w . in my actual testing it draws 1400w continuously , which is actually about twice as good as most smaller cheaper ceramic electric heaters or any other wire coil electric heater . the fan is not loud , it is also not silent , it needs to get all that heat dissapated and distributed . the wood is always cool to the touch , doesnt heat up and the power cable doesnt get hot either like some other electric heaters . it will probably look best on carpet , because on a hard floor the legs are above the ground a little bit since it sets on the casters , and the 4 wooden legs are just a bit higher than those wheels . on carpet the wheels will sink a bit so the legs look like they are on the ground . 
about $ 1-2 a day 
no . i am supplementing 1200 sf and it does a decent job . i got it because it has higher output than the others 
mine stays on 24-7===== my husband is an invalid and stays like ice -- i keep thermotat on 72 and he is just rite ! i am gon na buy another one of these for my kitchen seating area . 
yes , it 's stainless steel . 
pitcher is made in china , interior markings done in the us . 
yes , the markings are safe at any temperature . 
i purchased mine about 3 mo . ago . i use it daily for frothing milk and i hand wash it daily . it gets to temperatures over 150 deg . daily . the markings are as clear as new . therefore i do n't suspect any residue or toxic issues . 
the height is 3.75 '' . steve denton national etching 800-932-9273 
i think it is lifetime the box said , but there were no papers to send off for a warantee , so i guess there really isnt one lol 
only one . the medium pot lid fits the smallest fry pan . 
large pot holds 4 quarts ; medium pot holds 1.5 quarts ; and small tiny pot holds .5 quarts ; 
no , it is not oven safe 
8 , 9.5 & 11 inch skillets ; 1 & 2 qt.pots ; 5 qt . dutch oven . a great set ! 
no not at all 
the extra large fry pan ? no lid . the big pot yes . 
all i can say about sureguard is that the price was right and my son has not pulled the sheets off the bed because of the heat of the plastic from other manufacture 's products . there has been no mishaps so i do n't know how it is regarding wetness . 
yes . tpu to be precise . 
wife says temperature is normal not hot or cold . we are happy with it 
absolutely ... ... ... i just measured my total mattress depth and it is 12 '' . 
hi , i guess that depends on what you want from your mattress pad . it 's not pillowy or squishy or quilted in any way . it 's a thin soft short-pile terrycloth . i put mine under my mattress pad . 
this product will cover up to 20 inch mattresses , etc . so if you only have just that size and no deep pillow top , gel top or any additional items on your mattress then this product may slide around your bed . please `` read the size dimensions '' carefully . because there is nothing like buying a product and having to return it `` on-line '' . i have a 14 '' mattress plus a 4 '' each pillow top and gel top additions and there is still room so the product is great but if it is just for your mattress then i would not recommend it . most products these days are made for the deeper mattresses around 20 inches and up . just hope this helps . also , you can contact the manufacturer directly for more advice . 
the queen size would fit your mattress best . 
i have a regular king and fits perfectly . 
no . these mattress covers are made for memory foam mattresses . the side of the cover that contacts the mattress has a waterproof material to protect the foam . i use mine on a tempurpedic mattress with no problems . 
yes 
yes it is . our mattress is 14 '' deep and we have plenty on all sides , about 4 '' . very soft too ! 
my mattress is 12 inches deep , and it fits fine . the outside edge of it seems to be pretty strechy good elastic , so i 'm sure it will fit around a less deep mattress as well . 
it will be a little big for a standard size , but it does have elastic so it might just work 
i have a memory foam sleep number and i do n't even know it is on . so the answer is no . 
they stack fairly well but you 're going to need some pretty tall cabinets to stack the larger ones ! i only stack two of the shorter ones . 
no , the only stamp on the bottom of each glass is a number . i believe the name `` luminarc '' is used for these glasses as a type of heavy-duty , 10-sided , every-day usage type of glass , and not the french manufacturer . 
yes , they will and it 's hard to pull apart- i put one up and one down to fill shelf then extras on the tops of the ones that are upside down- otherwise the rim will break off trying to get them loose-if stacked inside each other- i had to adjust my shelves to fit the whole set-but it 's worth it-we use the smaller more than the large so i put a a few large in another cabinet . 
they are made in the usa according to the crate & barrel product page . http : www.crateandbarrel.com working-glasses-and-lid f1693 here is the luminarc page http : www.luminarc.org the-brand dinnerware-manufacturer % 281 % 29.aspx 
yes 
i finally got around to checking the box . yes , they are made in the usa . 
good morning anthony - yes may go on either side . the instructions to do so are included with the bed : ) thank you - scott 
good morning - i am not able to give you the weight capacity but can tell you the bed has met all the astm safety requirements for weight capacity . my understanding is the bed is tested with 400 pounds for a short period of time . this does not mean you should put 400 pounds on the bed . in general , beds that meet the astm safety guidelines have a recommendation of about 200 pounds of distributed weight per sleeping service . of course this will depend on many factors such as kids being kids and jumping up and down in one concentrated area or the thickness and quality of the mattress . i hope this helps . scott 
yes all that is included in total price . 
good day - the dimensions of the bed in twin size are 41 '' deep x 98 '' widex 64 '' high . in full size it becomes 57 '' deep . thank you for allowing me to assist you - from the # 1 discovery world furniture seller on amazon - dreamscape furniture : ) feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you need further assistance . scott 
technically no , but you could use them separately . you would have to do your own modifications . 
good day - the majority of our products are made with furniture grade pine from various parts of the world - brazil , vietnam etc thank you for allowing me to assist you - from the # 1 discovery world furniture seller on amazon - dreamscape furniture : ) feel free to call me at 8007719330 if you need further assistance . scott 
i ordered 8 inch mattresses and they worked perfectly . 
i 'm 5'5 '' and the top bed rail comes right to my eyes . i believe it 's about 98 inches long . 
overall dimensions : 39 '' l x 35 '' w x 38 '' h seat height : 21 '' seat depth : 22 '' hope this helps . 
not sure . but this chair is not wimpy . it is heavy and very sturdy . 
22 inches 
the angel set is a polyester blend material . 
if ordered from our company it does include the matching ottoman . i believe the listing for $ 279 is for the chair only . randy 
interior dimensions where the mattress sits are approximately 81 1 4 '' x 60 1 2. length outside measurement is 84 '' plus ( in case you need to be really specific ) there are little caps that cover screw holes that add perhaps another half inch to the length . width outside measurement is 63 1 4 '' . those measurements were taken at the corners of the bedframe - the rails on the sides and at the head and foot are set in just a bit from the corner . height overall is 13 3 4 '' and there is clearance of 8 '' between the floor and the bottom of the rails . 
well ... if you wanted to drill holes and screw them together , sure . there is n't any sort of built-in brackets or anything . 
i do n't have that information , but `` google '' best price mattress '' to contact someone there who can answer this question for you . 
i would guess you could . you would need to put risers on the 4 middle supports also . i do like the frame . 
i could not even get them to send me the correct pieces to the frame ! it took me over a year to get my refund . i do n't know that i would risk trying to get what you want . 
i weigh 240 and it handles me fine , and with my wife as well . as i put it together it was obvious it was a good piece of furniture . 
the interior space in 6.5 inches tall . the bottom of the storage area is 16.5 inches of the ground . the top of the table is 24.5 inches off the floor . overall i think almost everyone 's impression is that the tables are bigger than expected once seen out of the box . 
the inside is 22 inches in width , 7 inches in height . 
what do you mean by automatic pullout ? ? ? ? ? 
it 's roughly 40 inches . 
all toaster ovens get hot on the outside . this one seems to be reasonable - just leave room around it for cooling . the top can be used to pre-warm dishes . 
no 
depth 16 , height 12 , width 18 '' . 
you can set this to any temp from 150 to 450 at 5 degree intervals . 
yes , in particular , the glass is hot enough to burn ... ... ..but note that the handle extends out from the front of the oven and provides something of a preventative barrier ... ... ..we do love this oven 
first , i will not broil a steak in this oven , it 's too much of a pain to try to clean up afterward ... as far as the cookies go , just follow the directions on the package that the cookie mix came in ... it 's an oven ... you will probably have to adjust the cooking times as i have to get the results i was looking for ... not a big deal to do ... 
neither the box nor the muddler itself indicate where it is made . 
the length of the handle is 8 inches plus an additional 1.5 inch head . overall it measures a shade over 9.5 inches . hope this helps . 
you could if you use the metal end on a hard surface . make sure to place the ice in a waterproof nylon bag 3-5 min after taking them out of the freezer . cheers ! 
i do n't know but for this price , it 's not going to break anybody . it is very well made and balanced and heavy feeling in your hand . 
1.2 cu . ft . 
this oven is very quiet as compared to older models . you can easily have a conversation over it . the beeps are also adjustable to a very low volume . it does have a little vibration noise when running from the metal case around the oven . i lean a silicone pot holder against it to quiet it . 
no ... .the on screen light goes into a `` standbye '' mode ... the light goes out after a few moments on non-use but the clock time is still displayed . you can also have the clock time not displayed if you wish . 
yes . mine does . but i do n't leave it open for extended periods so i do n't know if it would go off after a while or not . 
no . 
this vacuum performed poorly on my carpet , which is n't thick . it 's quite flimsy , and has poor suction . it also emitted a strong smoky smell . it may be better suited on bare floors , but it 's not suited for carpeting . thank you for asking . 
no , but it is very poorly made and many parts broke easily . 
if you bring up the expanded view and click the center image in the bottom row , you can see the cord is n't retractable , if the photo is correct . it winds around manually on the rear . 
i think israel 
sorry , i 'm not the seller maybe you can refer the question to him 
suction base ? what for ? i do n't understand the question i will be mire then happy to answere any question i can say that it is the most useful tool in my kitchen 
off course ! you can prepare chopped liver , chicken salad , egg salad and many more things . 
i returned mine , the dimensions stated were different than in reality , did not fit my space , sorry ca n't remember what they were through . 
same , i just had to sort of figure it out . 
it is finished on both sides , so you do n't have to place it against the wall , however , i think it looks better when positioned this way . 
the bottom shelf measures about 23 '' x 11 '' deep . however the depth from the back board to the two 'legs ' which attach to the self is 8 inches . the space between the two legs is 17 inches . hope that helps ! would be glad to try to clarify if that is stated in a confusing way ! we have the table in our front entry and like it ! 
13 1 2 '' width x 9 '' length x 2 '' height 
yes , it is pretty sturdy . 
yep . it 's a great bed . 
mostly medium , especially after you get beyond the first 6 inches from the edge . the 6 inches to the edge , you will roll off until you get used to it . otherwise , medium . 
about 24 hours . 
no , it sits right on the 12 point base we purchased to go with it , no box spring needed . 
sorry but i hsve no idea 
oh my god are you serious hippy ? shaking my head and walking away.. wow.. 
mine was kept in its original box while we moved . it came out just fine . when you take it out of the box just give it an hour and you have a great mattress . i got it for my mom and she loves it . it really doesnt matter how long its in the box because thats how they are at the warehouse and that could be a long time . glad i could help , enjoy the mattress . sandy

circulon item # 56539 is made in china , manufactured for meyer corporation in vallejo , ca 94590 
the description and packaging states that these are made with non toxic distilled water , basically for safety.. however , that does n't mean that the plastic material is bpa free . i can not find anything on the actual packaging stating the the cube material is free of unsafe chemicals . but they brag that the water inside is non-toxic . 
yes 
i 'm not sure . will have to look at the package to see if that info is on there . 
absolutely ! 
i have not put them in the dishwasher , they are super easy to wash off and put back in the freezer though . i probably would n't recommend putting them in the dishwasher . 
not long ... an hour and a half . i love these things ! 
i 'm not sure , i have n't started making kefir yet , its on my list . the holes fit the tip of a ballpoint pen tip in them if that helps . 
hello heather , yes , there is a 1 year warranty on parts and material defects on the dehydrator . 
hello heather , we carry a silicone mat that can be purchased through our website . it is not available on amazon at this time . it is perfect for fruit leathers and other similar projects . 
hello heather , thanks for the question . the stainless steel trays and racks that hold them remove from the dehydrating chamber leaving an easy to wipe down surface with no brackets or edges . those trays and racks may be placed in a dishwasher or sink , however the whole unit should not under any circumstances be put in a dishwasher or sink . there are many electrical parts and components present . 
it works like any other foam pump . you can use the stuff made for foam pumps or you can use regular liquid soap and dilute it 1:5 . 
i use the soap that foams but i find that the dispenser sticks and is hard to use . the directions say to use any liquid soap and mix with water . i did n't like this result . 
i give it a little shake when i first fill or refill it , but after that no shaking seems necessary for it stay mixed . 
yes- the clear bottom plastic part unscrews from the upper white piece . marking lines on the clear bottom piece show the fill lines of soap water . use a thin liquid detergent for the soap to work properly . the liquid gel hand soap type does n't mix well with water . 
i imagine foaming soap would work . but if you only have regular soap the bottle gives you the ratios to make foaming soap for the dispenser . 
no drip , it stays clean . 
does come with 'cigarette lighter ' style dc adapter . but i would only plug it in when the engine is running . probably drain the battery otherwise . 
if i am reading the label on it right.. it says 45-50 watts next to teh ac info . but do n't hold me to that . lol

hi nancy , the storage area is 4.125 '' deep . there are , however , two small pieces of wood attached to the underside of the lid that take away about .75 '' from those two spots . i 'll try to upload a picture for you . 
4 pair of mens shoes , 5 pair of womens , i also raised mine up so i can fit shoes under the shelf . 
it needs to be about an inch from the wall in order to allow the back edge of the lid to hinge open without out touching the wall . hope that helps . 
i 'm not at home at the moment , but i think it 's about 2.5 or 3 inches . most of my shoes fit under the shelf , but thicker shoes , like clogs , get put on the shelf . 
yes , it 's 13 1 2 in wide . 
you can get one from bodum . they have similar sizes . 
not true , in my case . still looks like new . 
glass 
glass 
yes you can . i replaced mine with bodum 's standard cup after the original broke . 
why does this matter ? it 's a great product . 
this unit has an outlet for a hose attachment . a short plastic hose is provided or you can use a garden hose . 
approximately 12 inches wide , 11 inches high and 7 inches deep . the bucket is oddly shaped so it fits snugly into the housing so this is approximate . it is relatively easy to remove . dumping is made easy with the recessed handle that pulls up for use . 
it 's threaded to fit a regular garden hose . 
yes there is a drain in the back that you can hook up a hose to . 
in canada . 
the unit is no louder than any others i have owned . so far i love my microwave an it cooks very well . 
the front is 21.5 inches the height is 11.5 inxhwa and front to back is just a little over 14.5 inches . .5 meaning one half inch 
as described in another q & a , it is 21 inches wide . width being left to right as you 're looking at the front of it . the depth is 16 inches , and the height is 12 '' . 
you may not be setting the glass correctly on the turntable . it has to be positioned where the grooves are in order to operate correctly . try again 
i have never done that but i would think that with the right bracket any thing can be mounted 
yes the light turns on when the you open the door . also , the add 30 button works . one of the reviews said it did n't . 
asked my son , bought this for him and he says it is 12 inches . 
i could have returned mine . 
yes it does , but i think the panasonic is a much better item . i had to send my oster back . and got the panasonic . have n't had a problem with it . got the black one . comes with the cooking instruction book with details on how to cook any thing , and is big enough to cook 16 # turkey . hope this helps 
i just used mine tonight ! they are 2.25 '' across the bottom , 3.5 '' across the top , and 1.5 '' tall . i checked and they fit exactly inside my 6 hole jumbo muffin tin . 
most definitely , i have a gas oven and my breakfast muffins are wonderful and easy to clean after each use . i bought two sets , onw for myself and the other would be a great gift ! 
2.25 inches exterior . i love these cups . 
yes they are 
the silicone material used to manufacture this product meets all the fda requirements specified by the u.s. code of federal regulations 21 cfr 177.2600. this regulation comprises a list of approved ingredients and additives along with prescribed test methods to evaluate candidate materials for definition as `` food grade '' rubber products by the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) . the prescribed method was used by an independent testing lab to test the material used in this product to ensure it is safe for repeated use in contact with food at higher baking temperatures . they are made from fda approved , bpa free , food-grade silicone . 
no , its more like half size more 
please reply to this email with your customization request . 
8x10 
yes . if you pay the extra priority mail charge 
i believe it would melt the top . 
no absoluty not . 
no , it is n't . it will get ruined as there is n't a waterproof seal . 
it is an instant read so use it whether you are grilling , baking , pan frying or whatever . this is a great unit , i wouldnt be without it and actually bought one for my parents as well . 
no 
i have not had any problems . i use avast for an antivirus and they filter all the junk mail . 
china , where else ? i must say that the probe is stainless steel ( the only part that touches food ) and well manufactured even if from china . 
it does n't say anywhere on the thermometer , but i would assume it is manufactured in china , as are most items of this type 
yes the filters fit this model . i just bought the replacement filters on amazon . mr coffee makes the holder or what ever you call it that fits above the basket it is mr coffee wf10 this i bought at my local publix grocery store here in fl but it only comes with one filter . you are supposed to use one every month which is what i do and the coffee is much better i ca n't find the replacement filters except online . 
yes 
i use on a bvmc-pstx91thermal unit . perfect replacement . 
it 's a tiny , tiny bit smaller diameter than the filter that comes with the coffee maker but it will still fit just fine . 
here is the difference . if , a big 'if ' your coffee maker takes a paper filter that is round and has a flat bottom , it should work . if your coffee make uses a paper filter that comes to a point at the bottom they probably wo n't fit . round filters are sold in the stores in a see-through package and stacked one on top of the other , the pointed filters are usually in a box . unfortunately , you should have read the reviews on the coffee maker you have - just google in tjx37 and you 'll find a lot of unhappy customers for that particular model . if these round filters work for you each one will last one month , so the package you display with your question ( which is what i purchased ) will last a complete year . one critical thing ! inside your coffee maker there should be a 'filter holder ' , and it should have had one filter of this kind in side that frame , if not , it is not designed to be used with these kinds of filters . it is a little plastic frame that these filters fit inside of , then that fits inside the round opening that holds the round paper filter for the coffee - i hope that explanation is clear ? good luck . 
i do n't know if that model needs one or not . if it does , there will be at least one in the package when you receive it . the filter is good for about three months on average so you 'll have time to order more . 
yes they will fit . no problem . 
yes . the top and middle shelves are adjustable with two positions each . 
i am a petite woman but pretty strong . i put the bookshelf together myself . it was n't easy but also was n't incredibly hard . i did not apply the back board so that helped . 
30 1 2 inches 
unfortunately , the shelves are stationary . i use mine , all three of them , in my sewing room , and they hold bolts of fabric and sewing accessories . my grandson put them together , and all is good . i have been very satisfied with the purchase . good luck ! 
replacement filters are around $ 60- $ 70 and they last for one year . here 's the replacement filter listing on amazon : http : www.amazon.com brondell-hf-20-water-filter-replacement dp b00eedw3hw ref=sr_1_9 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1390586011 & sr=8-9 & keywords=brondell+h2o % 2b thanks ! 
it should . 
hi there , on the top of the pearl water filter system there is a circular window in the center of the top and if you look down there is a color indicator that changes when it 's time to replace the filter . filters last for one year with this system . thanks 
yes , the system comes with a filter cartridge which should last for the first year . replacements for the filter are easily available via amazon and through a variety of other retailers . thanks 
yes , the product comes with a filter . thanks ! 
the filter is good for one year and rated for 3200 gallons . the filter is certified for this life by the water quality association ( wqa ) so this is not just a manufacturers statement , but a certified statement that has been tested in a lab . thanks for asking !

i returned this filter because it did not work with my faucet 
i 've had both of them . the only difference i noticed was the intak has a ring right where the cap screws onto the bottle . it is for counting how many bottles you consume in a day . i did n't like it there . when you unscrewed the cap , you moved the dial . the tritan moves the counter ring to the very top . it no longer gets in the way and is easier to use . 
yes , it does ! 
yes ... .every 4 ounces to 20 ounces . that was never a requirement for me . i love mine since it never leaks in my bag and so quick to push , drink and close when in water zumba and water aerobics classes . 
yes . i bought it for my 7 yr old and she uses daily for school . 
no it does not have a straw but a perfect sized moth piece . 
i usually let it hang in my decanter . hate to waste a drop of my brunello . when i have it seems to drop way less then my last one that would almost fill the stand . 
no , you do not need to attach anything . simply hold the aerator over your wine glass . with your other hand pour the wine through the aerator . as the wine goes into your glass , it aerates . it is that easy : ) if you have any further questions please do n't hesitate to contact me & we 'll take great care of you ! also , this reviewer made a video review that might answer your question here : 
it does not have a metal filter that goes on top like some aerator 's have . it does however have small holes in the second stage that can filter out the larger sediments `` cork for example . '' most modern wines do not really have much sediment in them anyway , and if they do , you can pour them through a cheese cloth or into a decanter . if i am going to drink an older wine that i know will have sediment , i will pour it into a decanter , then pour it from the decanter , through this aerator and into my glass . cheers ! edit : also , no it does not come apart , that i am aware of . all you need to do is run water through it to clean it however . 
plastic 
not unless you are pouring the entire amount into a decanter .

top is plastic and bottom is glass 
i dont consider it blue at all , not ( aqua ) as it looks in the pictures . it is more of a seafoam green with darker teal outlines on the coral . hope that helps some . 
measured on the bed so not exact but seems to be 92 x 110 - use on a queen bed @ 90 degrees so it is long enough to encase pillows by folding under and then over 
i do n't know how many tread of it but it not too thin and i really like it as bed cover . for that price i think is good if you do n't have to pay for shipping . mine was not a good buy since i have to pay for shipping to hi . 
they are made in china 
no 
not sure what you mean exactly but if you want to know if there are sturdy yes very sturdy , a little on the short side 
yes . the measurements are stamped into the tops of the handle and are 3 16 '' tall . the top half has `` cups '' and the bottom half `` ml 's '' ( millimeters ) ) . because they are stamped they will not wear off , but depending on your visual acuity you may have to rotate it slightly , depending on the amount of lighting , to see the measures . i think it is fine , though . 
yes ! these are very sturdy cups and the handles are fairly short as well , so you can get a good grip when scooping heavy ingredients . 
the quality is very good with the measurements ( i.e . 1 2 , 1 4 , etc ) embossed on the handle . kitchenaide makes a set that are just like the bellemain set except there are half measurements embossed on the side . the cia set you linked appear to have inked on measurements which if true would wear off over time . 
infrared space heaters for the home emit long-wave infrared radiation , which strikes a solid nearby object and converts that radiation into heat . infrared is not absorbed by the air through which it travels . with infrared heating , the warmth is directed and concentrated where it is really needed , so infrared heaters are better at targeted or focused heating . infrared heaters are energy efficient , have no moving parts , heat very quickly , are silent , and are unaffected by drafts . if you are sitting in one spot for a length of time , an infrared heater aimed in your direction will be a good choice convection heaters use electricity to warm a metal coil , a quartz tube , or a ceramic core . the air near the heater is warmed in the process and , using either natural or fan-induced convection currents , circulated throughout the room . quartz and ceramic elements are reputed to reach higher temperatures with less input energy than their metal-coil counterparts and are thus said to be more efficient . they work well for providing overall warmth in a ( small ) closed space . in all models , the warmed air circulates into the room , raising the ambient temperature to the point established by the thermostat , and then shutting off until the temperature drops . if you are moving around in a room , or if there are several people in the room , a quartz or ceramic convection heater will be a good choice . they are both safe heating systems

it 's hard to say . we have been using a similar infrared for over a year with no real electric spikes . i do n't think it added much more than $ 10 a month with usage in the evening most every day . we just purchased 2 of these and have them running round the clock to avoid our propane furnace running . we also have a small empty rental that we have our other infrared at . it is currently heating the whole house round the clock . 
the unit 's control panel has no battery back-up system to `` remember '' what state of operation it was in prior to a loss of power . the heater defaults to the off when power is lost , then restored . 
yes , it rolls smoothly ... 
i 'm not sure what the difference is . i just know they ca n't run on a circuit with a lot of other things or they will trip circuit breaker . i had to move mine and put it on a different circuit but it has n't caused me a problem other than that . i really have n't figured out why it 's called plug and play . 
not a clue- all i know is that i downloaded because i paid for it and also am not happy with the product -it really raises electric bill . 
yes , it is real , it 's not at all wavy or having some fun house effect . i was really pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product ... i totally recommend it ! 
yes it does 
the mirror is the size of the front of the cabinet . it is approx 18 in wide by 4.5 ft long . i would actually measure it for you , but it was a gift for my daughter , so it is at her house . it is the size of a standard full length mirror , like the ones that stand on their own in a frame and bracket . 
bright white . 
yes , np even if you are quite cloise to it . yes , even if you are quite close to it . however , the view is better if you are a few feet away . y 
yes 
can not speak to cats but is effective on dog hair . just remember this is not intended for carpeting , just bare floors and you 'll be happy . 
qvc carries them . i think the item number would be v31722 . i 'm pretty sure they fit this vacuum , but the filter is washable too . 
replacement filters are available on amazon 
no they do not . 
no

no i do n't think so 
comes with a 1 year manufactures warranty . 
the a c requires a grounded electrical outlet within 4 ft ( 122 cm ) of where the power cord exits the air conditioner . 
the painting is shipped from amazon 's warehouse , so we believe it should not take more than 2 days . 
31.5 inch vertical 47.2 inch horizontal 
31.5 inch height 47.2 inch length 
no . i do not think so . the effects of the daylight as well as the ( harsh ) weather conditions will take its toll on the painting . sincerely . 
it is made of canvas , not sure that it would hold up to the weather or wind very well . 
not sure , have n't used one . it does however glow in the dark and is a great conversational piece , however frame came warped and bowed . 
yes . put the empty container or the scale , zero out the weight , then add what you are going to weigh . 
the box says `` made in china '' . 
it would say 1 lb . 8 oz . 
it uses one cr2032 button battery . 
1 - lithium , 3v cr 2032 
no , not that we have found . we use a clear glass plate and zero it out before putting larger items on it . at least them we can see the screen . 
i bought one a couple months ago and keep it stored upright without a problem . 
yes it does .

diameter is 2.5 inches 
2 and 7 16 '' sounds right to me . i just checked a couple of other sites and they had the same price as amazon for this particular filter disk , or slightly higher . checked the able brewing web site , and $ 12.50 is also the msrp . and for whatever it 's worth , my experience with amazon 's customer service has been pretty good nearly every time i 've had to contact them . had a few less-than-satisfactory exchanges , but nothing i 'd describe as `` trash . '' 
i do n't know exactly , but i bought one and had it installed . it may be just to protect the actual unit . it also keeps it really secure in the wall . worth the little extra cash . 
i personally used the frigidaire ea108t sleeve but the air conditioner comes with instructions for use with different brands of sleeves and also comes with different types of insulation for various sleeve installations . 
yes . it is 'thru the wall ' and uses a steel sleeve which is unvented on the sides , top and bottom . 
no . relatively quiet . i am happt with the purchase 
no the item just slides into the sleeve . i presume you mean the box that holds it in the wall 
i used the frigidaire ea108t 18 inch sleeve kit for the frigidaire ac ffta1233q1 12kbtu . fits perfectly . 
if you are attaching the mop and broom holder to dry wall you would use anchor bolts and if you are attaching it to wood you would use wood screws . hold the holder up on the wall where you plan to hang it . take a level and place it up on the top of the holder and use a pencil to mark the holes after you have leveled the holder . if you are using anchor bolts , drill holes into the dry wall and tap the plastic holder that will hold the bolts into the dry wall . after you have tapped them in , line up the holder with the holes and insert the bolts , them using a phillips screwdriver turn the until they are tightly inserted . if you are attaching it to wood , use the pencil method , the take an ice pick and start the holes . line up the holder with the holes and screw the screws in until the holder is tightly adhered to the wall . done ! 
yes , it does . i think they changed the design of this holder over the years , because at least two versions are pictured in the product images . one version ( older ) had two concealed slide-out hooks . if you like that idea , that design may still be sold by v-tech . ( it 's possible that an even older version had no hooks at all . ) the one i bought a month or so ago ( note : bought from sh toys ; amazon was out of stock at the time ) has six fold-down plastic hooks ( as in the first product image ) . they 're thick and fairly stiff . i ended up not being able to use it and gave it to a friend instead , but i liked the fold-down hooks . they seemed sturdy and well-sized . that said , if you use the hooks , you will probably end up blocking at least one tool . you will need to take things off the hooks to get those tools out . if you 're still considering this product , i hope my answer helps . 
17 inches 
i do not know the exact openings of this unit but they are wide enough that the wands from my vacuum fit . all my mops , brooms , etc are no problem . if you need the exact measurement i can measure when i return home ? 
sure ... unless the door is hollow . 
no it does n't . this holder is 17 '' long and the outside holes are about 2.5 inches from each side and then middle is about 6 inches apart . there is just 3 holes total . hopefully that makes sense . i do n't have min drilled into a stud and have n't had any problems . it 's definitely a nice holder ! 
about 350 grams 
nope- it is fantastic- i bought 2 and washed them a gazillion times - best blanket , ever . 
no 
this is a big blanket which will easily fit a regular king or california king . 
yes we are in fl and used it last night again with jazzmine rice . love it 
the company is a japanese company . there are offices throughout asia and in california , but i believe california is just a sales office .

at work now ... when i get home around 5:45 i can message and let you know . 
the green is more of a dark sage with some olive in the leaves . our bedroom is painted olive green and it does brighten up the room . it will keep you warm . i added some extra brown and olive green pillow from my previous bedspread and the colors bend so well together . sorry if this is more information than you needed . 
i do n't know i was buy these for my grand parents . i didnt see any curtians when i was looking but i was told it 's a really nice set . 
i do n't think so 
unfortunately we do not carry the full size . 
no they do not . we are returning ours after finding out the hard way . 
real copper . not just painted on . 
i do not know where they are manufactured , probably china . i have decided after using them for a few months that the stainless steel is not as good as some older pieces i have that were manufactured in the u & gt ; s & gt ; and show 18 10 on them or even 18 01. they are adequate , but they have turned some odd colors ( stainless steel ) from the heat . my older pieces never did . the copper seems to not be equal on all pieces either , turning a very light yellow on the small fry pan , while turning a brownish color on the other pans . even so , they do work pretty well and i like the fry pan quite a lot . hope this helps . 
stainless steel 
they are dishwasher safe ! though if you are wanting to make them non stick through seasoning its best to wash them by hand : ) 
diameter 8.5 '' ; inside pot 5.25 '' ; strainer ( inner basket ) 4 '' deep by 7.75 '' diametr ( will handle 1 lb . macaronie ) 
yes . i only cook brown rice in mine.i cook a cup of brown rice once a week every week . cooks it wonderfully . the cooker has held up nicely . would highly recommend ! 
there actually several plastic parts that contact the water , not just the window . there are two screw covers washers on the bottom , and a strainer that the water passes through when you pour it ( to keep sediment that forms on the bottom of the pot out of your tea ) . this strainer is removable , but the other plastic parts are not . 
the kettle is completely stainless steel on the inside . there are two small bpa plastic covers for two bolts at the bottom and bpa plastic window along the side with the measurements . the pour spout is also stainless steel . 
it 's made in china . thanks 
yes , one year : http : www.kitchenaid.com digitalassets kek1722sx warranty_en.pdf 
no the start button must be pressed to activate it at the certain temp you want . simply applying power to it will not set it in motion to boil or heat water 
no , the power in europe is to high it will blow the kettle up . 
oh , no . it is made in china . 
depth of the can rack is 11-5 8 inches front to back along the side frame ; so yes , it will fit ok on a pantry shelf of 11-1 2 inches depth . be aware that the lip of the shelf rack protrudes about 1-1 2 inches forward beyond the side frames ( total depth from lip to back of rack frame is just over 13 inches ) ; so if your pantry shelves are behind a door having less than 1-1 2 inches of space between the door and the shelf front , the door likely will collide with the lip of the shelf rack , and will not close completely . i have the can rack mounted on a shelf that is about 16 inches in depth , with the lip of the can rack protruding beyond the edge of the shelf . this gives me a space of just over 4 inches behind the can rack , which i can use to stack other stuff . 
if stacked on their sides , the cans can be set up to roll forward when the front can is removed . ( transverse rails which separate the rows of cans are moveable adjustable ; and if adjusted tightly against the can row are capable of preventing forward movement . ) the design is flexible , in that ( depending upon size ) cans can be stacked , rather than placed sideways in rows ; stacked cans usually will not move forward . 
no , they 're not really designed for that ; the back has additional wire support to give the structure more stability , not leaving enough room to load from the back . that said , these have been very good organizers for us . 
yes we have two stacked and its just great 
no 
the assembled rack is 13 5 8 '' tall at its ' highest point . cans the size of campbell 's soup ( 10 3 4 oz ) , on the top shelf , will still be under the highest edge of the rack . 
if the wires of your wire shelves are laid out left to right the racks will work very well because the bottoms of the sides of the rack are solid front to back . if your shelves have wires front to back , you would have to put some kind of a base under the racks to make them stand up the way they are supposed to for the cans to gravity feed . 
if adjustable base you mean one with the ability to raise the head and feet sections separately i would say possibly , though probably not ( it depends on the base ) . the mattress itself is fairly flexible so bending it is not much of a problem , though it may be too light and would not sit properly if the bed was adjusted . if the adjustable base is built with weak supports and straight bars you might find it uncomfortable ( i am thinking of a fold-out bed in a hide away couch here ) . on the other hand , the mattress is a premium high-density foam mattress and some adjustable bases are designed to work perfectly for these . while the manufacturer recommends you use a flat , solid base or the floor ( they do work great if you like minimalist furniture living ) i so think that it would work fine for any bed that can use a high-density foam mattress . a good rule of thumb is that if the foam mattresses from ikea could work in the base , this mattress should also work fine ( and cost half as much as the equivalent mattress from there ) . 
i would get the extra long if i were you . 
the temperature of the mattress is same as any other mattresses . 
hi julie , the measurements of the twin xl are 3'3 '' ( w ) * 6'8 '' ( l ) * 5 '' ( h ) . our beds are made to normal bed dimensions , and we do not offer any custom sizes at this time . thank you for reaching out ! 
these are statements from the anchor hocking website for the trueseal products : oven safe : use your anchor hocking bakeware in gas and electric ovens up to 425. freezer safe : use your anchor hocking ware for storing food in refrigerator or freezer , but do not take directly from freezer to oven . let food thaw before cooking or reheating in oven . 
they will stack for storage but i do it three and three because stacking all 6 would be very wobbly . they do n't fit inside each other as they are all the same size . 
the lid is silicone 
yes , i have used them in the freezer and they are fine 
23.5 is the width . it is 15.5 high 
vertical space between the shelves is 6.5 inches . 
it 's a wood grain pattern in an espresso color . 
i would n't . might support the weight of a child , but i do n't think it 's sturdy enough for an adult . 
the space between shelves is roughly 6 1 2 inches , so it depends on the height of the boots.. 
i think so . better if you use velcro dots between them for better stability 
i have the steam beach white combination and have n't had any issues with wet shoes causing problems ( and i 'm in wi where we have lots of sludgy , sloppy snow ) .

it works with my cricut expressions machine . if the cricut takes cartridges it should work . 
my unit pumps from my basement floor up to where the a c pipes leave the basement wall , about 6 ' vertical , has run for months with no problem . 
it will operate to temperatures down to 50 degrees ! i believe and it does have an auto defrost feature . i love my unit , especially the pump which allows me to drain the water into a sink . the only problem i had with this unit was leakage at the drain hose connection but easily corrected that by removing the plastic connector and inserting the hose further into the drain hole . i highly recommend this product . 
i use mine in a basement where it does n't get that cold . but if it gets to 30 degrees , that is below freezing so i imagine the water could freeze in the drain hose or the holding tank plus anywhere it travels in order to get to those places which might be harmful to the unit . just a thought , i do n't know for a fact . 
it needs to have adequate ventilation . i believe the instructions said at least 8 '' around . 
6 feet 
i would think that if you had it in a bedroom , the noise might keep you up and the heat it generated would make it uncomfortable especially if it blew on your bed . i suggest you put it in an adjacent room , maybe a bathroom , and it will will not be a problem . plus you can easily place the drain hose for the water into the toilet tank.that is what i did . 
i would say six to eight in . lowered the bed nicely , at least for us it did . 
it 's metal and very sturdy . i 'm very happy with it . 
yes , a headboard can be attached , although i was lazy and just propped ours against the wall . the frame has a pair of vertical rectangular metal plates at the two corners at the head of the bed . the plates have several horizontal slits suitable for putting screws through to attach a headboard . 
yes perfect snug . adjusts to all sizes . setup very easy . best frame i ever had . only thing no bolting bracket for footboard , just for headboard . 
you push them on and they kind of lock in place . not welded or screwed in . i really like this frame . i have a queen serta icomfort intellectual with boxspring and i am a heavy guy , and it works great . frame is really sturdy . 
measured from the floor to the bottom of the frame is 6 '' . 
we did not use the rollers but i 'm almost certain it came with all 9 
i did not get what i ordered . the one that came was a 6 leg bed frame 
the biggest one fits about 1 1 4 c of substance . 
i 've used them in the microwave lots of times . 
they are not 
yes . i put mine on the top shelf and have n't had issues with cracking or breaking . 
it 's a queen sized mattress . you 'd have to measure your sofa . 
no 
no , it 's only the mattress . it 's wrapped in plastic and will need an hour or so to reshape . 
made in america ! 
mine was a queen size and came in one box . it turned my useless sleeper sofa into a comfortable bed 
when fully opened the cart is 22 '' long . the cart itself is 18 '' wide , but the rear wheels are 24 '' end to end . the cart internal measurements are 17 1 2 '' x 14 3 4 '' and it is 24 '' deep . 
plastic . the shopping cart is garbage . you ca n't put anything heavy in it . if you do the wheels will come off . i just use it for laundry now . going to get another shopping cart . do n't buy if your going to put something heavy ini it . you been warned 
maybe 5 lbs not sure ... but very light ! 
i 'm not sure about the capacity but it seems sufficient for any amount of groceries . the cloth part is removable but not the wire mesh . 
about $ 150 . 
yes ! it does . as long as it is purchased within the promotional period , and you pay $ 199 or more for it . i even called the nespresso club to confirm that it would qualify , even if purchased through amazon . you just have to submit the receipt showing the purchase and amount . here are the terms and conditions for the special offer : https : www.nespresso.com promotion upload us yeppromo14 misc nespresso % 20yep % 20tc_revisedv1final.pdf 
yes . an americano is espresso shots in hot water . this machine brews espresso shots , simply add them to hot water and you have an americano coffee . 
it has an embedded heater with switch for hot or cold and sits on a plugin base . 
yes once you register the machine on nesspro 's site if it is $ 199 or more . 
it does n't use pressure the extract flavor it spins the capsule and uses centripetal force to pull the flavor out . it 's new technology . thanks 
no you have to order them online nespresso.com 
http : www.highseer.com pdf wae_wye_15_sales.pdf is the link to the tech specks . it will work down to zero f. outdoor temp . it is a 15 seer unit . it will give you an seasonally adjusted average of 15 btus for every watt spent . assuming an annual compressor running time of 650 hours , total annual consumption would be 520 kw of power . 
general rule of thumb is 30 btus per square foot . this can change by some other factors up or down . 
both , the constant display is for the thermostat setting , but you can hold down the `` temp up '' botton for 3 seconds ( or so ) and it will display the room tempature for just a moment . 
what 's the answer to this important question 
ls-4ch-siqt-d , 120v 60hz 1500w 
no it is just automatic or understood that it is on whenever the unit is running for heat fan 
not a large room . you need to be fairly close to it . pretty much like a regular space heater . it 's also heavy and does n't have wheels . 
65 degrees fahrenheit . 
suppose to heat up to 900 sf . i have mine in my living room about 600 sf with high ceilings and it keeps it warm . 
5 '' diameter - just measured it 
i have experienced these conditions this summer and it handled well . i also have a ceiling fan that helps also . 
no . too small . strong though . they are too thin or bottle cap . could probably do it if you doubled it up or even tripled them by stacking . 
i do n't know how strong other magnets are but here is an example of how strong these magnets are . i attached two stacks of five magnets to the bottom of a 16oz can was able to pull up and hold another 16oz can . 
woks on my frigidaire , not sure whats inside though : - ) 
neodymium - another chief use of neodymium is as the free pure element . it is used as a component in the alloys used to make high-strength neodymium magnets - powerful permanent magnets . [ 3 ] these magnets are widely used in such products as microphones , professional loudspeakers , in-ear headphones , and computer hard disks , where low magnet mass or volume , or strong magnetic fields are required . larger neodymium magnets are used in high power versus weight electric motors ( for example in hybrid cars ) and generators ( for example aircraft and wind turbine electric generators ) . [ 4 ] 
the collar stays are magnetic . i placed the collar stays inside of my shirt where it normally goes . i am a bit picky and i placed the magnet on the inside part of my dress shirt near my neck . it helps maintain the perfect stay . 
the most common stainless steel is type 304 , which is not magnetic . if you would like to learn the science , i suggest this link : http : www.scientificamerican.com article why-dont-magnets-work-on 
yes . in cooling mode fan runs in fan only mode , when the compressor shuts off . 
the inverter driver is the compressor only for this version . but do take note that seer is not a systems overall efficiency , look at the eer rating as well , they have full inverter systems rated at 21 seer , where the active filter module , power module and rectification and reactor system drives all the motors in the system allowing them to achieve much higher efficiency , which is the same as the full inverter fujitsu units and full inverter mr. slim . mitsubishi and fujitsu also offer mid-range inverter equipment to 14-16seer just as pioneer has with this system . all equipment specs and engineering information is available at the manufacturers website . highseer.com . and one more thing , i have 6 of these unit in my home now , and they are fantastic , not to mention everyone who sees them gets jealous and wants one lol . 
i have the 9k btu model , the indoor unit is approx . 26.5 '' wide , 10 '' high and protrudes 7.5 '' from the wall . my connections will exit the wall behind the unit so they will not be visible . 
this unit requires 208-230v ac power . i suppose it could be mounted to a semi truck , but you would have carry around one hell of a generator to power it ! 
yes , there is a small condenser unit that is located outside 
made in taiwan 
just one . i am using mine for pepper ... 
yes it does . i did n't mention in my review that it has a nice shape that makes it easy to hold and use . 
i have no problem what so ever.i love my mill grinder 
no 
yes 
joec , not sure what your question is , but i 'll assume you 're asking if over sized pans work ? yes they do as long as they are induction compatible . we purchased a larger pan for making hot pots , and it works rather well . i do n't know if there are any differences in heat consistency on the edges of the pan since the coil does n't line up with the edge of larger pans , but we 've not noticed anything to difficult . as i 've said before , the fact that lifting the pan , say to flip turn the contents causes the unit to pause and you need to push a button to restart ... hope this helps . 
i think it will be fine with it . i used my staub dutch oven on it and it was fine . you might simply test it by placing your pot ( s ) on it with some water and start the burner . it will either work or it will e out . good luck . it is a great addition to the cooking realm . regards , jay 
you have to pay special attention to cooking on this stove . everything happens quickly . if you were making the fudge you were speaking of , i believe it would do a great job , you just can not walk away from it . for me it is the perfect stove i use it for everything . my old electric stove sits unused now except for the over . 
use the newave to make cheese , yogurt and beer . processes that require precise temperatures both low and high . what separated the nuwave from other burners is that it can keep temparture below 120f . some of the rescipies call for high temperatures , +190f , to kill unwanted microbes then holding a low temperature , 100f , to support wanted microbes . i uses an external temperature gauge as a backup and both reading always match . 
you can hear the fan for sure , but i do n't find it overly loud or noisy . the fan under my microwave is 100 times louder ... this is more like a small cpu fan ... . 
major difference between those 2 models is max power . nuwave pic can go up to 1300w and nuwave pic pro high powered can go up to 1800w . in practice it means that you will be able to cook `` faster '' with pro high powered model but in the same time you will need to make sure that the wiring for your kitchen outlet is 20a . if it is not the case you will face frequent pops of your fuse on this outlet or create fire hazard if installation is not done properly . just as a safety precaution manufacturer equips this kind of devices with special plug that will not fit regular 15a outlet . it means you will not be able to use it in a lot of places where there is no 20a outlet . i personally own basic version and it is sufficient for my cooking needs . nevertheless if you are power hungry you may look for 3000w induction cooktop from other makers . this kind of equipment will set you up for alteration of you kitchen wiring to 220v . in general it is not that difficult since the most american kitchen should be pre-wired for this possibility . 
the pan has to be magnetic . if a magnet sticks to the bottom of your pan it will probably work . pure aluminum and pure stainless steel pans will not work . most pans that will work on induction cookers will have `` induction suitable '' stamped on them somewhere . i bought a circulon symmetry pan and it works great . here 's a link for amazon 's circulon line ... 
1300 watts and 120 volts 
yes , the pans have to conduct a magnetic field so they have to be made of steel , cast iron , or one of their nuwave pans . 
hi noel . the nutone is pretty much universal . we noticed that it was a tight fight , when we tried connecting it to the wall connector . we had to file down the hose connectors to fit inside the hose adapter . once this was done , it worked great . christine 
no 
no it does not : ) it does not need one . this is a low voltage hose meaning the power nozzle on it is air driven and not electrical . because of that it does not need to have a pigtail or direct connect connection because the power nozzle does not use electricity . the hose is electric in low voltage which allows you to turn on and off the central vacuum unit with a flip of your finger but that is it . because of this you just plug the hose into any central vacuum outlet and it works . no pigtail or direct connect needed . if you are looking for the electrical version of this kit that uses the pigtail connection we also sell that one in our store . let us know if you have any other questions : ) thanks dustin greatvacs 
this kit is terrible 
i do not believe so . however , if you measure the the male part of the older brand and cross references the new one , you should get the exact details needed to make a choice . 
yes , but it dosent work very well . it dosent pick up anything bigger then a dime . and if you have carpet that has any length at all it dosent even do that . 
i 'm not sure . item specifications indicated that it 's a 'universal ' system . we have a beam central vac and it works perfectly . 
i am not aware of any warranty . we 've had the set 6 months , all parts working fine . 
it 's thin but great quality . i 'd guess 1 8 inch . it 's fantastic . i use it all the time to make granola and baked goods . i love it . 
no info of that type is provided . it says that it 's made from fda approved materials . i love mine . 
i do n't really know , but i do n't think i would chance it either . it is too bad that it is not made in a smaller size or varying sizes do to all different companies making there own varying sizes . i guess if it did not fit my pan snuggly then i would save it for one of them that it does , and would probably use parchment paper . it is just too bad that bakewear ca n't be made to be indistructable . oh well what is a person to do . 
it 's `` hard '' but not as hard as a shoe - more like a sheet of plastic hard enough to cover the sole of a shoe , but you would want a shoe inside this . it is not a boot , it is a covering for shoes . ( even sandals could go inside , but you need more of a sole than this provides . ) 
i really doubt it . only for emergency 
i wear a 7 and they are too big for me maybe too small for a 9 .but i just wear a sling shoe inside . hope this helps . 
the soles are not slippery , yes they have traction , i work outside , and i really appreciate having such a nice boot that is not heavy on the feet , comfortable and slips easily over my workshoes , i purchased the large size and maybe could have gone with medium , i take a size 8 1 2 women 's work shoe , i have worn them in storms and working in the yard several times , and thank the dots for the boots further the price is right ... ... 
i took these to ireland with me but did not need . i tried them them on at home they fit over my shoes which are a womens size 8 . 
hey there , lynne . unfortunately , they do not come in sizes . i 'm a size 8 and have n't had any problems . 
yes , they are reusable . i do n't know how they 'd hold up for long term heavy usage but with care they should last quite awhile . 
you mean bpa ? i do n't think it mentions in the manual , but the smaller containers are all glass and the strainer seems to be made of something like pet . the bigger container is probably the most likely to have a bis phenol issue , but if it bothers you , some small canning jars the same size as the included jars will work pretty well . 
if you are experiencing any kind technical difficulties , please contact oster direct for more trouble shooting assistance . 
yes , i actually use 2 one quart plastic containers much like the included one with great success . the lid of the yogurt maker does n't fit all the way down but i increase the cooking time to 12 hrs . the mason jars work the same . i like greek yogurt so i use the larger quarts and strain , then i fill the mason jars . 
yes . 
no , this model does not automatically shut off . i do n't find it to be an issue , though . 
definitely yes . i do it this way all the time . i just double my recipe and put part of it in the jars and the rest in the container . it works fine each time i 've done it . i think you 'll be happy with the results . 
the ckstym1012 does not have any replacement parts . 
i do not know , but it is standard hole , i believe all the cutting blade knifes has the same hole dimensions far all type of brand kitchen mixers . sorry that i did not answer fully ... . 
i do n't know about your machine that does work very well with my kitchenaid attachments 
sorry do n't know , used it on my kitchenaid grinder attachment . i know it does n't fit that . 
hello , we do n't have the rights outside the usa so we can only ship within the usa . thank you david 
thank you for your interest in this bedding set . i am disappointed to say that this bedding set comes in the queen size only at this time . 
we currently only have us rights and we are trying to expand those rights ! 
the comforter is 90 x 92 inches and the pilloow shwms are 20 x 26 designed to . fit quenn full size . thank you for your interest . 
90 x 92 inches for the queen size comforter and 20 x 26 inches for each standard size pillow sham . thank you for your interest . 
mine is queen , why ca n't amazon answer this ?

according the seller , the units are the same , but the `` w '' means it was a batch manufactured for walmart stores . 
distilled water . not just with your panasonic l70srw any iron that uses water . 
if you meant what is the difference between the ni-l70sr and the ni-l70srw , the w is simply the color designation for white but it is sometimes left off . 
the product specifications state : 120 volts ac ; 60hz .

one year limited warranty to defects or workmanship 
maybe 2 pounds . 
yes . it 's a retractable cord . you just give it a slight tug and it is self winding . 
yes it is.. but you can still use it . it will be slightly larger.. it wo n't be a snug fit but it 's not that much of a deal but for a truly great fit i suggest you go buy a queen size pillow i think you would be happier . 
more of an ivory cream . 
i 'm pretty sure the dimensions are there under description at the bottom 
i really do n't know , but they are the same size as all my other pillow covers . 
single . 
no . there are only certain products made that specifically say will reduce dust mites , allergens etc . you have to look for pillows and pillow covers that say this . however , if you put your pillows on high heat in dryer you can reduce and possibly kill certain allergens . if you think you have a big problem with dust mites or anything else that is a problem it 's probably best to replace pillows and mattress if older than 8 years . 
the pillowcase is 30 '' long and 20 '' wide . it has an envelope closure . made in china 
no , you do not add water . the unit collects water over time that you must drain from time to time . 
yes . it comes with the 4 '' hose . you *could* run it without , but i would n't recommend it because otherwise it would be like running a heater and an ac unit both at the same time . they can get away with it at hardware stores , because the store itself is not reliant on the portable ac unit 's cooling . i would n't trust any portable ac unit that did n't have a way to pump the hot air out . also , i 've used these units in sliding glass doors . the way i did that was take a piece of wood that fit inside the door , say 7 ' x 12 '' and cut a hole with a jig saw big enough for the ac 's exhaust vent hose . then i just screwed the vent to the wood and could close the screen door and still have the ac working . i 've seen people run the exhaust hose through floors before , say in a crawl space , but my opinion is heat rises and that could make the floor hot and might make the motor run hotter . 
no 
yes , i believe it will . pretty much anything in the 10k to 15k draws quite a bit of amperage . i made sure mine were plugged into a plugs that were pretty much isolated . you definitely do not wand it plugged into a line that also runs computers , tv 's , stereos , etc . it will cause undue wear on those , or anything with an electronic brain and could cause an early death . ( seen it . ) sometimes by just re-arranging appliances you can even things out and save yourself a headache later on . 
no ! it 's a pain to drain . but you do n't have to drain it a lot , unless it 's very humid . it does have some nice fitures , the oscillating fan and the energy saver mode . also it was $ 400.00 at home depot . amazon $ 259.00 . i have ( 2 ) of these , no drain hose . good luck finding one with correct size thread . 
at the bottom of this link they tell you which nespresso machines it 's compatible with : http : www.sealpod.net news category sealpod % 20bigsisinox95f9eae4c2 i ca n't see the c50 , try to contact the company . 
i am not certain , but i 'm pretty sure that it is not ... there is a huge size difference 
with the nespresso machines that makes 3 holes in their nespresso capsules , the capsule are compatible with all of them . but the nespresso machines that makes 1 holes ( usually with a handler ) , the capsule are not compatible . ( because the machine makes the hole too deep ) 
no . it is not made of down . it is a down alternative . much better for my allergies and i could n't be happier with the softness and comfort ! : ) hope this helps ! 
it was too hot for me . it 's not noticeable when you first lay down , but by the morning i started waking up repeatedly from the warmth . i tried to move around but any spot i moved too got too warm after 10 mins . 
no.. extra plush double thick is the thickest and plushiest size . ( ( trust me i checked the website & # 128513 ; ) ) 
i sleep on my side most of the time . my mattress was new , but too firm and a bit warm . this makes it very nice . 
the elastic material that goes around the mattress is generous so it will fit literally any mattress depth . 
the dimensions are as stated by the seller ... 88x92 . had to work a bit to get my comforter in but it fits fine.it really is pretty ! 
i will check with the manufacture . 
yes , under the home and kitchen category search multi batik tapestry . this is a beautiful duvet , i hope these pictures help . happy apple 
yes this comes in size 96 '' x106 '' , which should fit a king size bed . to find the bigger size search under multi batik duvet and the two sizes will be shown . the bigger one is $ 105 , free shipping with prime . thanks , earle at happy apple 
they are really hard to find and very expensive , if you want something with the same look , i would go to ikea 
it 's just the dinky wedge that goes in the corner . very misleading pic . the actual desk is like 400 bucks . 
it is literally just the wedge that fits in the corner . it is shaped like a slice of pie . 
hi , thanks for your question . according to the information on the product page and the information on a supplier 's website , the drawers are included with this piece . i hope this helps ! 
thanks for your question ! this listing is only for the desk . the other items in the picture , such as the lamp , frames and computer are just props to create an image of how the desk might look in its intended setting . i hope this helps !

the dimensions are listed as : full queen 88 '' by 90 '' ; the king is 90 '' by 108 '' , and the twin twin xl is 68 '' by 90 '' . 
i bought a queen fit my queen perfect i have a bedskirt on my bed 
nope 
88inx88in 
a duvet cover is actually a cover for a comforter . so the all season down comforter could have a duvet cover over it for decorative or just simply protective purposes ... . like pillow cases 
a duvet cover goes over the comforter . 
not sure ! i got the king size ! we have a queen sized bed ... but after reading someone else 's review ... decided to go with the king as well to let it hang more off the sides . the length is extra long ... but i just fold it back when i make the bed ! we do n't fight over covers . love my comforter ! ! ! 
it is about 8 '' tall . 
5.5 '' high 
nope . this unit fit on a tilt head 5qt model only per i.e ksm150ps models . thanks 
i have the prof 6000 from costco . the bowl is more narrow than the other professionals and taller . it would n't fit mine . if you check out kitchen aids website , you can ask their customer service people . they are pretty helpful . 
yes 
if you have a mixer that does not have a long handle to bring the bowl up and down , than yes , it should fit . 
your kitchenaid model k45sswh appears to be the approximate same model as the kitchenaid i have , as i compared the descriptions , this cover fits our mixer perfectly . all i can say , is if it does not fit and you are buying through amazon , there will be no problem of returning the cover if you are not satisfied . although , again , i believe your model is the same size as the model i have . the height of my kitchenaid mixer is a little over 14 inches . 
yes . it will work for that model . 
yes ! and keeps clean my mixer . 
the kitchenaid stand mixer i own is the artisan series tilt head and this cover fits perfectly . i am unsure of watts . hope this helps . 
i 'm not sure ... .i have tilthead and it fits on mine ... 
yes , i think it can ... 
no , it is not cotton because it is water and fluid resistant . it is a synthetic but it is not 100 % vinyl . it is zippered . i have seen several types and like this one the best . our pest control guy recommended covers in general since we rent out several furnished apartments and a good offense is a must . he cautioned that this does not mean you will not get bed bugs but only that they will have fewer places to hide . 
no its not 
yes it is . and a vecro on tab end so it doesnt unzip , , its nice you dont know its there , like you do with plastic 
i am not sure , but i do n't see a reason why it should n't . 
no this is a duvet cover - it snaps on the bottom and you place a twin size blanket inside - granddaughter loved it and had real good service , comes from great britain ! 
it is a coverlet ... has the texture of a sheet but is double sided and thicker for warmth . kind of both . 
this is equivalent to a twin size in us with measurement of 198 x 137 cm . 
the size is approximately 23 '' x 23 '' x 10 '' 
hi jeannine , the number of slices depends on how tall your cakes are if they are as shown ( where they over lap each other ) it can easily feed 150 people ! we had 35 guests show up so we had cake fir months because i wanted a big cake for presentation . this also includes saving the top tier for the wedding couple : ) 
yes it has the same dimensions for a queen size bed . and you do n't need a bed frame for this type of bed ! 
just ordered it last night , if i 'm correct it shouldnt be more than a 6 foot flat box . 
400 to 500 pounds . 
it reminds me more of bronze than black brown ... i think it would look fine with a black dresser or accent table . 
yes 
id say its about a foot off ground 
there should be an instruction manual . on the front above the 'plus ' plaque , ' there 's a grey-colored 'knob . ' turn the knob to the left and remove it-then , pour the the water into that canister . 
yes mine does 
just bought this last week . comes with 4 pads . 
yes but do n't leave water puddle behind 
yes ! but , just keep at it . overall , it 's a good mop ! 
get part number off of your old pump and run it on the search at amazon . sometime amazon will show you some items that do not match your part number , be sure the part numbers match . 
get part number off of part and run it on e-part replacement part web-site to match it to your model number . or just take part number to amazon from your part and put in . 
yes 
yes 
i bought the pans for my daughter for christmas & luckily she still had the box . they were made in china . she is very happy with the pans . 
if you email the company they can get one for you . 
i love the cookware . am very happy with the quality and have had no issues in the 6 months or so that i 've been using the set . 
some of them are like one on the pot lids also fits the frying pan . 
the pans are not flimsy in the least . they are very strong , and seem to be very good quality so far . 
not at all . 
no , because the pots are made of aluminum , which is not magnetic . induction cooking uses magnetism to heat up the cookware , which in turn heats the food . these pots can be used on conduction stoves ( gas and electric ) . 
the set includes : 1-quart saucepan , 2-quart saucepan , 5-quart dutch oven , 8-inch saute pan and 9.5-inch saute pan 
yes 
no . there 's an opening on top with which to drink through . 
hello sherry d. the packaging states that the item is bpa free . thanks for your inquiry , julie 
holes are probably small enough for most leafy blends . the problem with this product is that the infuser tube does n't extend far enough into the jar so it only works when jar is full . so it 's great for making a small amount of tea ahead of time but not so good for fruit or herbal infused waters to drink over several hours which is what i bought it for . 
mayb a mayonaise jar 
no it does n't it has a slit to drink from 
it is a lid for wide mouth mason jars ( you can even buy them with a handle ) - for drinking , water , ice tea and lemonade are great - it has an infuser to put lemon or mint leaves in for flavoring in water or tea . i love to use it for flavored water ! 
unfortunately , no . only in the wide mouth size . 
depends on if you put it in a wide mouth pint jar or a wide mouth quart jar it 's just the infuser lid dose not come with jar fits both i love this thing cut up a lemon and put in there it works great 
i 'm not sure . it is made of hard inflexible plastic . i guess you could , but i would look into a cuppow for hot drinks . 
no actualy it did n't come with pillow case and i do n't have it now.. thank you 
i got these from ikea . torsby vilsmar 
yes 
you do n't have to worry about the shelf being removable . my table came with no shelf . at first i thought it was missing , but there is no mention of a shelf in the instructions either . but the missing shelf is the least of any worries you should have . i can honestly say that this is the most pathetic piece of particle board garbage that i have ever had the misfortune of buying . many holes did n't line up . globs of dried glue on the finished surface ( corners ) , missing hardware , and some small cracks in wood pieces . the instructions were pretty good though . took over 2 hours to put together . too much trouble to take apart and try to piece back in the box to return . a total waste of a hundred bucks . : - ( 
yes 
yes 
i did n't measure it myself , just copy pasted the dimensions from listing : product dimensions : 23.7 x 11.8 x 23.4 inches ; 40 pounds 
it is nicely dense . i have a king bed made up of 2 twins together and bought this to put on top . you can not tell there are 2 beds and it is heavenly to sleep on . so much better than a plain mattress . conforms to your body nicely but returns to original shape quickly . i can not see a reason to buy a thicker one . 
no , it actually stays quite cool . i love this topper . 
sorry i have no clue , what you are talking about ... . but it is just god sent . loving it after great work out ~ ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
mine is queen size , 60x80 . 
i have the 3 gallon and it fits perfectly . 
they fit the 3 gallon crock . on the inside cover is the number 3. we purchased both the crock and the set of 2 lids so we could make sour kraut . 
yes , here is the link . http : www.amazon.com rug-doctor-universal-hand-tool dp b009b496lu ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1400411947 & sr=8-1 & keywords=rug+doctor+universal+hand+tool 
it is about 35 pound empty . when you fill it , it is closer to 50 pounds . 
no . hand wash only . ours cracked after a few months . : ( 
i pretty sure you can since it is class 
it 's glass and very nice except that the metal handle is attached with some sort of adhesive and according to the label ca n't be machine washed . they are glass with metal handles . nice , except they ca n't be machine washed . 
usa 
yes 
i did hot tea once ... be careful ... the metal handle gets crazy hot ! ! ! 
no 
they are tiny , just enough to extract to extract the almond milk , not the pulp , 
the large bags are huge ... you should be fine to do that much.. if not a little more.. 
it 's takes just a couple minutes to strain the milk and you can squeeze as much or as little as u want . i let the milk run out on its own as much a possible before squeezing . if you want the absolute most out of your almonds , there is a fair amount of squeezing twisting , but nothing that 's `` excessive '' . 
i never counted , the apple looks like a spiral of apple when done , like an accordian of apple , all cored too , then if you cut in half you have apples being ready for a nice pie . used to have one when i did daycare , the kids were so delighted with it 
my experience : there are no differences except for the paint color . to my knowledge all are made in china . i have bought several as gifts from different companies on-line and retail . one ( green color ) i bought from bed , bath & beyond several years ago and still used frequently was $ 19.95 less a $ 5.00 certificate . go for your best price . loopy is a good company . received in 3 days after ordering via amazon . 
i try to find the most regularly shaped apples for that reason . sometimes , however , the nicest ones are not so perfect in shape . i figure if i have to do some touch-up it is still better than doing it all by hand . my issue with this device is that there does n't seem to be any way to adjust the thickness of the slices , and that is something i would like to be able to do . 
we just recieved this a few months ago and peeled @ 10 lbs . it worked great . 
the arm attachment does not extend that far . 4 '' diam is about as large as you will be able to get through it . 
no you can not adjust the slices , but it 's the coolest little gadget that i have purchased this year and the kids love the slices ... 
it fits my daughers full bed very nice it 's a great item 
yes but also purchased them through amazon the comforter comes with two pillow case holders and the set of sheets as well so you will have an extra pair i love the comforter it 's very soft colors are vibrant worth every pennie . 
hi..no ... only the comforter and the shams 
each opening is 16 '' wide by 12 '' high 
17 inches high 38 inches long and 18 1 2 inches deep 
hello ! if you scroll down further they give you this information to you . product information ... .. : - ) 
it is a blueish green leaning towards blue- hop ethat helps 
the dimensions are listed in the specs at bottom of page . 
the pots do not have any type of teflon on the inside cooking surface . the pots pans are made of a rock particle making them unique in the kitchen cookware products . 
yes 
yes - as well as on non-induction cooktop . i purchased this set to replace some of my older cookware and to use with my induction burners . 
according to the stonelineshop website , they are different brands 
we do not recommend washing in the dishwasher , as you should simply wipe out the pan with warm water and paper towel . you can use soap and water also to clean the pan , but no scrubber or sponge with abrasive surface . 
hello thanks for your inquiry ! all of our stoneline cookware can be used on induction stoves . hope this help ! 
yes the pans can be used on induction stoves . 
we use it almost every day on a gas stove . heats evenly . the square sharp is easier to fit items that the old round one this replaced . 
as far as i know , there is not . to reduce spatter any good screen cover will do . 
yes ! i love it it is a great pan 
i do n't know . 
i try to keep the temperature low enough to avoid burning but high enough to get a good `` crust '' . i spray the pan with pam for the grill . being a widow , i make one hamburger or piece of steak at a time . i have n't had a smoke problem but do have a spatter issue with meat that is too fatty . i think you get that regardless of the pan used . i love this grill pan . 
yes it will cook nicely on a glass top stove . 
i do n't know , however , it is not as heavy as cast iron but heavier than most non-stick . i have n't had a problem with sticking or burning although i do n't use it on very high heat . i like to pan a lot . 
yes , it has hydraulic height adjustment . i love this chair . 
i suppose you could use it without the wheels just fine . legs are sturdy 
yes , it rotates 360 degrees . 
no . the back and the seat is one unit . however , the whole seating can be tilted forward . 
yes . my husband does hours and hours of work for his business . he sits in this chair the whole time , and said he is comfortable . now if he should do that is another matter ! 
hello ! i used premium leather cleaner and conditioner . i have a lot of white furniture in my home and i use this for all of them . it works really well . hope this helped ! : ) 
no , i can only adjust the height of the chair , not the tilt . 
7 l 2 h x 9 l 2 w x 5 l 2 d. top removal tray is 4 l 2 h. i love this organizer . it holds a lot of make up and brushes . 
top is 9 1 2 ww x 5 '' d x 3 1 2 h bottom is . 9 1 2 w x 5 12 d x 4 1 2 h it is well made and works well . it has two side by side small drawers and two large drawers , plenty of room for my cosmetics . 
1 1 2 in tall by 51 2 in the 2 small drawers and 1 1 2 by 10 in the 2 long drawers . good quality and sturdy . 
no 
i never actually measured the amount i put in . i fill them up and pour some out . sometimes the balls crack , but i 've never had one crack apart . i use filtered water . maybe that might make a difference . 
hi mitch , all our products are manufactured in china . thanks rizzi meia palma fresher products ltd 
mine were slightly flattened on one half but i guess i just need to fill them up a little bit more ... did n't want to overfill because of expanding while freezing . still happy with the result ! 
i have run mine through the dishwasher many times without any problems . 
these are soft plastic and are not made of melamine . 
yes i 've used them in the microwave . i love them , they all fit into each other and save space and i 'm loving the colors 
unfortunately does not have a delayed start . due to food safety issues delayed start not a good idea . you can prep the food on the spit rods and keep refrigerated until ready to cook . this product is the best . 
15 pound turkey 
you need a special rack for the ribs and we did n't buy it . sorry we do n't know . but otherwise we really like the item . 
yes there have to order from ronco website 
it says 1250 watts on the back of the machine . 
i have n't done a prime rib but i 've done a 5lb whole chicken , it does n't say in the manual either 
yes , we have not tried yet though . 
i believe the digital display and the vent system of the 5270 is the difference . i have a 5270 and i love it ! 
no : ( 
sauder products have a laminated finish . this one is called salt oak which is a kind of a gray , weathered look similar to a `` barn siding '' finish . 
the width is 21 '' , the depth is 19.25 '' and the height is 18.5 '' . 
yes . i have 55 '' on mine with about 4 '' left on each side . 
yes , at least parts of it . but we are pleased with the look of it . 
it is like 50 pounds at least 
yes you do have to assemble 
it will accomodate a 60 '' flat screen weighing 135lbs or less . 
at the base it is 6 inches across then it widens to 7 inches and widens again to 8 inches at the top . it 's about 4 inches deep . i use it almost daily . it 's the best steamer i 've ever owned . 
yes , because of the taper it will work with most other companies sauce pans . 
that depends on a couple of things ... how much each member will eat and the type of vegetable you are steaming . having said that , the steamer will hold an ample amount . we like to steam broccoli , green beans , cauliflower , potatoes , peas and the like . some obviously take up more room than others . but we always seem to have enough for our meals . hope this helps . by the way , it 's great for eggs . i steam mine rather than boil them . i do a dozen at a time - takes about 17 - 18 minutes depending on how hard you like them . 
absolutely ! a large cauliflower may be tight , but if you cut in appropriate size pieces you can get it all in . 
it is n't stamped `` stainless steel '' , but it definitely is . i have occasionally forgotten for several hours to empty the water from the pot below , and the residual moisture would have long ago started to rust regular steel . 
yes . it will steam fresh or frozen vegetables . 
i do n't have circulon pots but it fits cuisinart and a couple of other brands in my collection . the tapered construction pretty much guarantees it will fit just about anything of a normal diameter . 
thanks for your question ! according to the product details the dimensions of this item are 19 x 31.5 x 45 inches . the price varies depending on which seller you choose to purchase from . here is a list of all the sellers that are currently selling this item : 
they are 171 2 inches front to back inside 
this straws are 9 '' long and 19 64 '' inches in diameter 
approximately 7 mm . they are not large like milkshake straws . they are slightly bigger than a standard drinking straw . i like them very much ! 
i did n't have studs to screw into so i just used anchors and 4 .750 '' wood screws . it is full of bottles and is still very sturdy . 
yes . just be careful not to screw too tightly into wall to avoid cracking . i also used a bit of double sided tape towards the inside bottom so it does n't stick out i could n't tell if it was my wall but an easy fix 
they are molded to the backing and at each end . the first one i ordered came in perfect condition - very heavy-duty . the second and third ones arrived cracked and broken . but still a good solid product . 
it has four screw holes . very easy to put up . 
the one that i received did n't have any markings or names on it at all . 
yes 
hi , you could , but it would need to lean on something.. the base is n't super sturdy and it might get too heavy with tons of polish on it . 
i ca n't really say how many but my son uses it on a regular basis and the co2 lasts a month at least . i get mine refilled at the local paint ball store and they only charge me $ 4 . 
you can refill the tank anywhere that sells food grade co2 . you can do a google search for places in your area that would be able to fill your tank . from our rough google search we did n't see a lowes store that can do an exhange for you . if you so choose , you can also purchase a `` exchange '' priced full co2 via our primo store webiste ( http : store.primowater.com carbonators ) . this will allow you to gain access to a $ 15 dollar discount . all you have to do : when you receive your new co2 , use the prepaid return label to ship back your empty co2 . 
this bottle is actually identical to the one used by paint ball enthusiasts and that is where i get mine filled . the store owner said it is the same one he sells to people who do that sport . i hope this helps you . 
hello . this bed shield will roughly fit a 48 '' x 48 '' sized sofa bed . i hope this helps ! 
plastic which looks like a sheet of cardboard but very strong 
yes , it folds up . 
i do n't have a temperpedic so i ca n't speak to that specifically . my mattress is 13 inches thick and untill i got these suspenders nothing worked . i can not sleep on wrinkled sheets . these i have helped me get sleep . unless your bed is shaped like a circle i would say these are adjustable enough to fit most rectangular shaped beds 
yes ... thats what i have them on 
yes 
if the flat sheet is folded with hospital corners , it keeps them in place 
no , not yet . 
i would find out the dimensions of a hospital bed mattress and compare . the queen size which i bought was true to size . i do not know how it would fold like a hospital mattress ; once it has filled up with air after unwrapping , it is rather firm . 
when i bought this mattress i also bought sleep master platform metal bed frame mattress foundation , queen . this provides a nice foundation for the mattress , the mattress and frame are very light and easy to move , and there is storage space underneath the frame . if you have a standard frame built to take a box spring then you made need a box spring or lay some plywood on the frame first . but i just went for the mattress sleep master frame combo . for $ 400 what the heck . i 'm very happy with it . 
no , it does need a platform though 
no 
it appears to be firm enough , but no guarantee over time . i put ours in our rv so it is completely supported underneath . i will say it provides for an amazing nights sleep , it is a great mattress . 
no 
yes ! 
foam is not too dense . there is adequate give 
thank you for your interest in our product . the item you are inquiring has a width of 22 ' keyboard slide . thank you 
it 's already assembled . the whole desk only took me 15 mins to assemble and it is wood , not particle board . 
very solid construction . not that i 've tested the weight limit , but i would guess over 100 lbs 
yes , the drawer opens up then if has a latch on each side to drop down the front of the drawer . it is elegant desk that i am satisfied with it . 
yes , the wolfgang puck oven has a standard mode which cooks just like your traditional conventional oven . 
a 10-12 lb turkey 
19 1 2 wide 12 high and 13 deep ( all inches ) 
yes you can cook ant thing in it . 
it is about the same side as an microwave 
i have n't tried but based on your ability to set the temperature as low as 150 i ca n't see why touch could n't if you 're looking to cook whatever it is during the same process . set shorter time at lower temp , no steam and check it after 5 minutes etc . then reset for normal cooking 
when it worked for a week or so yes but need to add some water . nutibullet works great too also needs some water added . i liked the idea of more power with the bella but it did not last kim202wob mdt5n25a 
i actually just used it for some soup it did the job so i would say yes ! 
yes 
yes , i have 220 volts in jamaica and it works great 
hi it will cost more to buy these separate- ( 129.00 compared to my 49.00 ) this i love because my friends , co workers and family have the bullet and mines work just as good 75 % less and way more extras parts . as not to boast or brag i never tell them what i paid . since they already spent 80.00 bucks more 
i do n't believe so . this is designed for 120v . if you have an adapter for the change of power , thst should be good . 
yes . it even emulsifies little things like flax seeds . it does that with the regular blenders very well . i did n't even try it with the flat blades they intend to be used for that yet . 
you can choose to heat milk without froth . 
yes it is 
i do not know the exact number of ounces that it will froth at once , but there is a different amount you add for frothing a latte vs. a cappuccino - there are lines marked inside that you fill to . just generally speaking , it is enough for one serving at a time . i have it in the office and it is fine to froth for each individual 's drink - it is pretty fast , so not generally a problem . 
you 'd need a step-down adapter of some sort to 110v 
yes , but it quit working shortly after i purchased it - less than 3 months of use . 
you definitely should do that if you want your booze to taste like sunscreen . 
yes sir i think that is a possibility , however i would sign up after the cruise . 
poured it in . the top has a large hole to pour the booze in . it was easy . i strongly suggest this item ! ! 
mine did not come with seals . i took a piece of plastic wrap and put it over the threads then screwed the cap on . as for buying seals i really do not know . hope this helps . 
they do n't have time to look through everyone 's items , at least on cruises . they look like the real thing so why would they ? 
no flexible plastic 
i googled the metro co and got : `` for over 80 years , intermetro ( metro ) has been the world 's leading manufacturer and supplier of storage and transport products in the food service , commercial products and healthcare industries . founded in 1929 , the company is headquartered in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , and has offices throughout the united states and internationally . '' so , that still does n't say , but you could call the company and ask . this product is wonderful . i used it to make green smoothie popsicles all last summer ! 
it holds four ounces of liquid filled to about 1 4 inch from the top . pretty big . 
they are lead free . they are very well made and the holder is too . you get a few extra small parts . 18 8 stainless steel is a good strong material that wo n't bend or leach anything into what 's in it . 
no 
you get 6 replacement bits with your purchase . i have n't needed to use any of the extras yet . 
i believe the signature series has stronger suction than any of the previous vacuums . also , the signature comes with the regular bladed `` brush '' , while the xv-21 comes with the pet bristle brush . the signature pro comes with both brushes . you can also just buy the pet bristle brush separately with the signature vaccuum to make get the `` signature pro '' for less money . 
not sure what the official documentation says , but , the neato signature has a charging base station that plugs into a wall outlet . inside the base station is an ac to dc converter similar to what laptops use to charge their batteries . this provides all power . the converter in my base station is marked as input 100 - 240 vac , and output is 24 vdc @ 2 amps . in addition , the power cord can also be removed replaced to accommodate other plugs . 
one year . for details : http : www.neatorobotics.com warranty 
no it can not 
i have hardwood floors and it works fine but it 's very loud on hardwood floors so i just set it on a timer and it cleans while i 'm not home 
i got the pet hair adapter because i have two long haired pets and i have long hair myself . i have hardwood floors with rugs and it does an amazing job . i 'm actually shocked at how much hair it gets up daily . i 'm not sure how it does with the original brushes . 
no , you 'll need to either order the kit ( like i learned the hard way ) or just buy the signature pro and it 's included with that model . so far we are very happy with this machine , it 's worked very well . 
suggest to use it in a small closed room , not larger then 180sq feet ( 8'h ) . 2times of 15 min . 
no it runs briefly and then will shut off . 
you can smell the ozone when it is working . i would guess that it would effectively work for at least five or more years . 
yes , fan engages when ozone is generated 
hi janet . this unit does not have filters that need to be replaced . thanks . 
yes , it should work fine . keep in mind the system generates pure oxygenated air which has a certain scent we are obviously not used to due to all the impurities we breath in all day however , since you do notice the difference once the ugly odors are gone . you can air out the rv by simply opening the door for a few minutes after the system is off and voila ! and the pure oxygenated air will dissipate a bit . voila ! fresh clean rv 
regular outlet in household . unit is small but powerful . i have used it for cigarette smoke and food smells . works well . i like that i can set the time it runs and intervals for stop and start 
i do n't know but my recommendation is dont buy ! ! ! the kettle failed after four months - it did not switch off and boiled dry to the point of melting the plastic base . more than four months after contacting the seller we are still waiting for a refund . 
made in china . 
yes , it can used to heat sak , but ... you would have to monitor the temperature as it warms . the lowest set-temperature on this model is 175f . warm sak should be drank at about 110f to 120f so if you allow it to reach the set temperature of 175f - 212f not only might someone burn themselves drinking it too quickly but you 'll also ruin the flavor and the potency of the sak . the best way would be to use it as a double boiler by pouring the sak into a sak server and placing it into the hot water . just make sure that the water level is not too high so that it may be too difficult to retrieve or that some water might get into the sak . if you do pour your sak directly into the kettle make sure to clean it out well afterwards as there will be some residue in the kettle that could scorch and give an off flavor to your next cup of tea ! 
it 's 120v and 1500w . 
hello vanda , it is very quiet . but does beep once boiled . it has a useful keep warm function and heats water to 4 different temperatures . i have not read the instructions so have no idea if the beeps can be disactivated 
well , there 's no setting for 205. it 's 200 , then 212. but tap water ( 84 in se texas summer ) to boiling took just under 6 minutes . the light show makes watching a pot boil pass quicker . ; ) 
no 
it 's a slick surface , but just like any surface- wood , formica countertop , plastic or stone , you 're going to need to flour it ... the dimensions- as noted in the title are only 10x15- so you 're probably not going to want to roll pie dough on it- but if you 're rolling for pasta- it 's probably going to be fine so long as you flour it properly ... 
no feet and no grippy service but it has never slid off the counter - i love this thing . 
we have never sold black cutting boards . our cutting boards only come in the natural color you see referenced above . 
i never used an electric knife . for a regular knife , the board remains very smooth . no particles come loose from the surface . 
it can be used without the doors and is still quite attractive and structurally stable . 
the individual cubes you build are 14.5 '' deep , but you can configure the build , so your final height and width are pretty much up to you . i have several and if you build them without the back panel , you can get a couple of extra cubes out of it . i also left off the top panel of the row at the top . 
yes 
i 'm not sure , but it falls apart very easily . ours is still sitting in pieces on the floor until we figure out a better way of keeping it together . 
yes , it can be assembled any way , but keep in mind , you only get as many walls as shown here . since the 2 middle rows here share a few walls , you would n't have enough to split this into 2 equal separate halves . you could do a different configuration but you would have to go smaller somewhere to have enough pieces . 
i believe it 's no more than 30lbs . but i 'd say between 20-30 lbs . it 's great by the way . i 've moved across the country with it ... i own other dressers and chests ... hard to believe such an affordable solution could be so effective 
plastic , makes a great display 
plastic but was n't described as such 
there are slots for 32 pairs of earrings 
this jewelry armoire is the best for all types of jewelry , you just have to know how to organize them , otherwise you will hav trouble to keep the the door closed.. but everything fix there perfectly if you know how to acomodate them ... all my friends who had seen it.. lov it ! ! and mee too . 
no it is way to heavy no brackets 
no , but it 's easy to assemble . 
no you need to use an adapter 
the base has rubber feet , no inner rubber seal . the seal should be in the blade lid . 
absolutely not 
yes it does . 
not sure your exact question yes the cups are the same however this is just the base no blades or cups so yes you could use the cups for the 900 on this 
yes , it just wont be as powerful 
better for grinding up the harder stuff like nuts , carrots or frozen fruit . 
they are normal bat towel size ; 27 '' x 53 '' . they are just the right size for me and my husband . they are also the right thickness for us ; not too thin but also not so thick that i ca n't wrap my hair in them . washed them several times and so far they have held up well and continue to be soft and fluffy . 
54 x 27 x 0.5 inches , they are very nice towels . you 'll need to wash them once first to get all the excess lint out of them . after that i 've had zero problems . 
i do . ca n't imagine having white towels and not bleaching them , although i do think they say do not bleach . 
they are white . 
hi amalia our towels ( sold only by owl towel ) are 54 x 27 x 0.5 inches 
hi angela , thanks for asking - yes we do offer both hand towels and wash cloths but they are both currently out of stock . replacements are on the way to amazon though . thanks for asking ! 
hi c. , thanks for asking . we are new to amazon but to the best of my knowledge the last review ( 4 stars ) from ronald richman is . the others are from purchasers from our retail operation - we are asking every customer to give us reviews . hope that helps . 
i would have to say no . it is a small table . four people with four plates takes up all the room . you ca n't put more than one serving dish in the middle . if you have plenty of room around the table it would work for plus size people . i am plus size and the chairs are very sterdy . 
i have used mine only 10 times and har had it for a few months but the cord rewind works like a champ . best stay out of the way of it or you might get whipped . 
no . you can set it to bare floor height , which seems to be fine , in my experience 
yes ~ just the one filter . easy & quick to do . 
just shy of 25 ' 
it does a pretty good job . you have to use the attachments to get the edges and corners . 
no ... i typically spend at least twenty minutes vacuuming each bare floor to try to make sure i got it all . 
there is a 3 year warranty on this product from bissell . it does not include belts , filters or brushes . the warranty also states it covers the vacuum for personal use but not commercial or rental properties . 
sorry to hear about the trouble with your hose , make sure the extension wand is removed from your hose and that the end of the hose is firmly pushed into the lower hose to tightly secure it . if you are still having trouble please reach out to us ! http : www.bissell.com contact-us ? cid=ccsocial2107 
the top is 4 1 2 inches bottom 3 1 4 , height 2 1 2 
yes 
i would not think so if your percolator has the stem coming up in the middle for the water to come through and percolate over the grounds because this basket has no hole in the bottom to fit over the stem of your percolator . 
got this is a replacement basket for a mr coffee machine about a year ago . ( if that 's any help ) 
2 1 2-3 inches.it is a universal filter basket and should fit any size coffee maker up to 12 cups . 
solid 
i have the 12 cup . however i believe this would fit . it is a little smaller than my basket but works great . 
ginger w. no ! i tried it in an old bunn i have , it 's way too small , rattles around in the basket . al 
cool mist . must sit level . 
yes . it has an on off button behind the humidifier above the usb-cable connection . 
9.5*7.5*7.5cm 
this grinder grinds very well . if you turn it back upside down , and grind with it upside down , it will grind extremely fine . definitely enough for a vape . but not on the first grind . hope that helps . 
yes 
yes..you certainly could ! it might be a bit tricky like you 'll have to cut the cinnamon sticks in pieces first then grind it , same as the cloves . the teeth of this grinder is extremely sharp so i warn anyone using this grinder on not throwing caution to the wind..it could cut you without you even knowing it so be very careful using this . other than that it 's a superb and finely made grinder . i have used mine for many things including herbs like thyme and rosemary , whole peppercorns and big seeds . a highly recommended product and you can not possibly go wrong getting this for yourself for it comes in handy . i hope i answered your question . : ) 
i 've had the opportunity to use a space case for a short while . i want to start by saying it is a really great grinder and that i can see why it 's considered the best . both griders do the same thing , not one better than the other . i would say the space case is built a bit more heavy duty , but that is mostly for aesthetic purposes . what it really comes down to is if you want to spend that extra money for feel , not extra function . the ggg really is top notch . it looks great , grinds well , the keef screen never clogs , and there is plenty of room in the middle chamber to store . space case is viewed as the best becase it has function and feel , but that comes at a price . ggg gives the same level of functionality , with slightly less aesthetics , for a much much much better price . so overall if you have cash to burn i guess get the space case , but really your not going to get much more bang for your buck . 
manual . but it 's a very smooth twist . 
yes it does an amazing job with fresh herbs ! 
i did and it worked fine . daughter brought friends home for an extended visit and i set up the den with air mattress on frame . worked ! 
the full size includes 2 bed frame pieces each measuring 27 & # 8243 ; x 75 & # 8243 ; 
just like the photo - 2 frames clipped together for all sizes except the twin 
absolutely . however , keep in mind that this already brings the bed 13 '' off the ground -- which is twice as high as a traditional frame . so with a typical 9 '' box spring your mattress will start at around 22 '' off the floor . a typical mattress is anywhere from 6-18 '' so you could end up with a very high bed . 
this frame is designed to be used as a frame , platform , and box spring without needing any additional support . 
yes 
yes 
designed in usa , made in china 
this cutter itself can also shape rice . for pocket sandwich , please see this article http : www.allthingsforsale.com bento sealed-pocket-sandwich-easy-tutorial 
you can use the other shape cutter as rice crispie treat mold , and use the inner face piece as stencil for sprinkle . please check out cutezcute facebook . https : www.facebook.com photo.php ? fbid=491893687550836 & set=pb.246604052079802.-2207520000.1375817368. & type=3 & theater 
the small face details ( for example , eyes , nose , ears ) can cut thin-sliced cucumber , but you can not use the outer shape to cut cucumber as the cutter is bigger than a cucumber . the small details that you cut can be used to create other faces . there is a guideline on how to combine small cutouts to create other fun shapes on cutezcute web site . also , if you would like to get a vegetable cutter , i recommend using this http : www.amazon.com cutezcute-stainless-vegetable-cutters-cutters dp b00dtjrack ref=sr_1_34 ? s=kitchen & ie=utf8 & qid=1390419009 & sr=1-34 
i have and it works ok not perfect just ok .

this was a gift to my daughter , who has a flat top range , and she loves this cookware . she said the food heats and cooks evenly.she very happy with with the set and wants more pieces . 
i have washed it in dishwasher on light wash with no problems . 
the 2 pans that my wife received look kind of small compared to what we normally use . nice looking but smaller than i think they should be . 
the interior is made of an non-stick material . i do n't know if it is teflon or an improved version of it . the interior seemed like good quality . you will have to check with the manufacturer for the exact specs . porcelin bottom pots are not recommended for electric cooktops . make sure this rachel ray set is appropriate for the type of cooktop you have . 
yes . it can . and it is a great product ... had 1 pan ... then had to buy the whole set 
no , 
no . a magnet will not stick to the bottom . 
yes , i would rather use an electric stove with these because the handles get very very hot on a gas stove . my daughter has burned her hands several times using these pots and pans . 
actually that hole is important . first , if anyone was to try to fire a ceramic piece that thick , it would likely shatter . second , it helps air get into the handle when you cook , making the handle cooler when you get ready to serve the tasty stuff to your guests . i have had good luck with these , by the way . 
alas , like just about everything else , they 're made in china . wish they were n't but ... 
they appear to be the same . if i read the ad right on amazon they 're asking $ 60 ? i would buy off of the other site for half that . they 're nice soup crocks but really , do they need to cost all that much ? it is soup after all . however , they are a good buy at $ 30 . enjoy them whatever you decide ! merry christmas happy holidays ! 
i 've never tried that , but i am guessing that if you put your bowls in the oven to bake the cheese on top you would find them too hot to handle . 
it - the handle - warms up a little ( yes it is touchable ) in microwave but does n't get too hot to touch . 
chef 's catalog ( click 'details ' tab ) says they 'll hold 20 oz -- http : www.chefscatalog.com product 29623-chefs-french-onion-soup-bowls.aspx others have answered a similar question and have said a little less -- which is probably more realistic , unless you always fill to the brim . 
about 2 1 4 cups , good sized , i love them , especially for french onion soup . 
sorry , i do n't have an answer to that question . i would say it is a standard medium sized bowl , but i know that is not much help . when i get home i will see if i can use a measuring cup to give you an answer . i am planning on making onion soup tonight anyway . 
yes they 're broiler safe . i just stick them in for a couple of minutes until the cheese bubbles and starts to brown slightly . these bowls are great ! 
yes , and it 's super easy to set up . 
it parts in the middle for entrance or the sides can pull completely back so bed linens can removed replaced . 
the holes are n't the smallest but i could still see it working ... 
its light pink or kind of baby pink 
no 
no . not at all ! 
yes , it 's quite large . 
i guess it could be recessed but we just wall mounted it . it is a pretty cabinet . 
no it does not . 
mine measures just over 7 inches . the middle and top are adjustable . 
hello , it is white , pure white , thank you . 
hello , the back is board , yes , includes hardware to wall mount , thanks . 
the actual depth of each shelf is 7 1 4 ins . each shelf measures 21 1 2 ins . long . there are essentially 3 shelves to use . 
thank you for your inquiry . no you ca n't it 's a ceramic water dispenser . 
i just flip it once a month both side fill good to me 
this latex mattress is the perfect answer to any adjustable bed frame . not only does it mold to your body but it molds to the adjustable bed frame . in addition it has two sides- a medium plush quilted top and a firm quilted bottom-giving you the two most popular options for your sleeping comfort . as close to a custom designed mattress at a fraction of the cost . ninty five percent of all adjustable bed frames sold are twin xl ( 38x80 ) as two of these make an eastern king . roma mattress contains 6 '' of natural dunlop latex made up of one 3 '' layer firm dunlop latex and one 3 '' layer of medium soft dunlop latex . these layers are encased in an organic stretch cotton cover quilted to 1.5 '' of super soft reflex foam to match and marry the feel of the latex contained inside . both sides are quilted as sleep ez brings back the tradition of a two sided mattress flippable mattress . 
a standard twin roma mattress weighs approximately 70 pounds . please let us know if you have any other questions . thanks ! sleep ez 
twin xl is 38 x 80 compared to a standard twin at 38 x 74. twin xl is one half of a standard king 76x80 ( sometimes called eastern king ) and is the most popular size mattress for a king mattress with two adjustable bases underneath . the roma mattress with dual firmness , depending on which side is up , allows you to select either firm or plush comfort levels . 
hi joy ! i just dug out my box - the four sizes are : 21 cups ( 5.0 liters ) , 12.7 cups ( 3.0 liters ) , 6.3 cups ( 1.5 liters , and 3 cups ( 0.7 liters ) - all are nested together and all come with lids . these containers are really amazing and we use them every day for storage and cooking . i find myself wishing i had another set ! 
the approximate sizes are , large l10 '' w10 '' h 5.25 '' 2nd l 8,5 wq 8.5 '' h 4.25 3rd l 7.5 '' w 7.5 '' h 3.5 '' l 4th h 5.5 '' w 5.5 '' h 2.5 '' all containers are tapered so bottom dimensions are a bit smaller . 
they have a really tight seal once you squeeze out the air . 
this is n't meant to attach to any other product . it simply has a valve that allows you to press a little bit of extra air out , it does not allow for a vacuum attachment of any kind to suck air out . 
it never has with me and i have a high power microwave . really love to freeze in them . no ice buildup in them .

i know that there are some paula deen sets that are hard-anodized . i 'm not sure about this particular set though . 
i 'm sorry , please tell me is that like and electric cooktop ? if so it says in the info to use low to medium heat . i hope that helped . brenda 
you want the dc `` inverter '' . this is what makes these little units more efficient . the inverter allows the ac to run at a range of speeds , and not just on and off like a regular ac system . it keeps room temperatures more comfortable while using less power . 
go to the highseer website . they have a pdf you can down load with all the facts . so far , the unit has been great . 
if you go to highseer.com and this item you can find full specs . the heat is typically about 500 btu more than the cooling . but keep in mind that the amount of heat decreases as the outside temperature falls . so you might need fall back separate electric gas heat for some occasions . 
half ton ! 
with a new install you should pull the max . vacuum you can for at least 15 min . to dry the indoor unit and line set , then let it sit while checking your gauge set making sure there are no leaks half hour min . then follow instructions to release the gas from the outdoor unit again checking for leaks - i use a leak meter ( a $ 250.00 + tool ) . i hope this helps if not please post agian . ek . 
this although somewhat different then a residential `` split system '' still requires most of the tools and equipment required to install a split system . vacuum pump , gauges , flaring tool , some electrical stuff generally-just to mention a few . it is by no means a window unit that you just plug in and go . 
it came in three boxes . the condenser unit which was approx . 3 ' x 2.5 ' x 2 ' the blower for inside the home 4 ' x 2 ' x 2 ' and the coolant line set box . 2 ' x 2 ' x 4 '' 
paper wrapping . 
i got a queen shipped in to me 
no . it was just the mattress . i had to buy the box spring foundation separately . 
hi kenneth , the $ 189 is the price for two stools . they are sold in pairs because of the shipping . 
the seat height is 28 '' . 
same height 
hi toni , the seat is 28 '' high . hope this helps . woodward 's cottage terry 
hi cristy , that 's a good question . to the best of my knowledge they have never been rated for weight load . i do know that they are used in commercial establishments and have not heard of any complaints . bamboo is one of the hardest woods used for chairs . if i can be of more help please let me know . woodward 's cottage terry 
i do n't know the answer to that question . i would encourage you to look at the specs on the pot that came with your unit . 
thanks for posting , according to the product description , this glass carafe fits models bco320t bco330t . i hope this helps ! 
no not correctly . 
yes 10 cup 
thanks for your question , according to the product details , this carafe fits models bco320t bco330t . i hope this helps you determine if it will fit your model or not . 
yes , very well . and so much easier then a broom or even a swifter . 
monika , yes you can definitely use it as a short handheld vacuum ! it is modular in design . just the power sweeper , the extension pipe , and the power head canister . just plug the power head canister directly into the power sweeper and you are good to go ! by the way ... after you unpack all the components from the shipping carton , it takes about 5 minutes to put together and you are ready to vacuum . i am physically challenged and i use the vacuum the way i described and i can vacuum my carpets from a motorized chair with no problem . i did contact shark and made a suggestion to make a shorter extension to go between the power sweeper head and the power head canister to make it easier to vacuum from a seated position . i hope this answers your question . i certainly like mine ! 
should be fine for anyone , less work than the hose dragging a canister vacuum behind your . 
this is not cordless but is a great vacuum . 
yes it does ... 
i 'm not sure . i registered the product and the manual states a 5 year limited warranty under normal use . 
yes , do not come with it , the frame and headboard . mattress , it is , just . -yoda 
yes very easily 
it has a cover 
yes , mine is on slats and it 's working fine 
i do n't think so 
i would classify it as medium..no too soft . 
yes 
no , you can not fold it up . 
no i do n't think so . you would ruin the matress 
28 1 2 '' 
it 's really simple all you have to do is attach the legs , the rest comes put together already . 
table top 40 '' x 22 '' height 18 '' table top raises to 24.75 '' 
yes , just discussed this with the company 's staff over the phone . 
it does now ... http : www.androidcentral.com igrill-devices-now-work-android ? utm_source=ac & utm_medium=dlvrit 
yes graphs the temp rise . gives you a 10 degree alert to ready . great product 
yes you can . probes are available on idevices website . http : idevicesinc.com 
i believe it would for sure , as i have tried it with my iphone 5c and it was working great , so i assume that it would be the same , if not better with iphone 6. hope that helps ... 
not sure about the minimum , but meat right out of the refrigerator registers in the low 40 's . i have n't stuck it in the freezer yet , but maybe i 'll give it a try just to test and get back for another review ! this device is not a piece of crap as yankee man seems to think . for smoking and cooking on my traeger , the registered temps are very accurate , and being able to track everything on your idevice is awesome . setting custom cook temps is great ! i use the app on both the ipad and iphone . 
i do n't think it 's `` instant '' , but within a minute i would guess . i have not tried it . 
as long as there is a way to get the cord out and the temperature stays at 572 f or below , i do n't see why not . note that it does n't have a display or alarm on the transmitter , so you have to keep your phone or tablet in range if you want to know the temperature . 
unfortunately not yet . they promised me in the future . st is great company i did n't get answer when it will be integrated or who set 's the priority 
i just received my unit a week ago and it is v1.6h . i have trouble getting it to work though . 
it should . 
i have large home with adt pulse but due to the limitations of adt pulse i also have a mi casa verde system installed . this will not work with adt pulse but it works with the vera system . the only negative is that the remotec does not communicate with the my split system remote . so if i turn on my ac with my remote , the remotec does not recognize that the ac is on from the vera ui . 
their hub supports zwave so it is compatible with the hardware . however this from their help center site would give me pause `` also , staples connect is an open system . other devices ( including z-wave , z-wave plus , wifi , and lutron clearconnect ) may work with the system but we ca n't guarantee their full functionality . '' 
yes 
this will work with any ac with infrared remote control . if the ir codes are not available built in you should be able to teach the unit the ir codes using the original remote . 
i threw away the box but they are tin -- -made exactly like mason jars but with a hole for the straw . 
no they do n't 
it is a little hard to pour from if you 're trying to hold the glass in one hand and pour with the other . i have big hands and i can barely manage to do it . condensation also becomes an issue though because it makes it slick . 
just rinse it out really well with hot water immediately after finishing the beer . the person filling will rinse it again when you go for a refill . 
i do n't know . i have seen standard koozies that work for glass & steel for normal shapes . i would be interested to know as well . 
hi , not that we 're aware of but we will check with the manufacturer and let you know . thanks , lloyd at ed 's broadway 
hi george , our growlers are not compatible with other dispenser caps . 
it 's a full size growler ( although , it does n't look like it ) so half a gallon . 
2 trays . one each green and purple blue . thanks . 
it 's 100 percent cotton to it can be out in the washing machine . i bought a king size for a queen bed though . that way if it shrank it would n't be too small 
if i remember correctly it was blue . i sent the set back because it was not grey but more purple lavender . hope this helps . 
throw pillow 3 , 2 shams , bed skirt , comforter . colors are lighter than shown on line 
it 's 100 % polyester fiber 
i thought the comfortor would be more grey than it actually is it 's more of a grey lavender color and the pillows are blue it 's not exactly what i expected but i still love it and feel it 's very well made i kept it and love it ! 
yes , i just used a magic eraser to clean them . it works perfect ! 
the writable chaulkboard area is 3 '' x 2 '' . the overall is 3 '' high x 3 '' wide . very cute when used for a party buffet 
i want to know that as well , too bad you did n't get an answer 
regular cupcakes ( not muffins ) will fit in this , but the only way you can get one in is by either not having icing on it , or knowing the icing will be messed up . 
you can slightly tilt to place cup cake in the holder . but i suggest removing the holder from the hook on the carousel , then place the cupcake in the holder and hook it back to the carousel . 
the measurements are in the description : `` product dimensions : 18 x 7 x 13 inches '' . 18 '' is the height . 
the brand name on the box is francois et mimi . nothing says godinger on it . 
no , it wo n't have the space . the spot that you would do you work will be the spot the key board will be . i suggest a wireless keyboard . then you might have the space you want . 
the dimensions of this desk is 40.25 x 19.5 x 33.25 '' h 
i measured it quickly using an ikea measuring tape so it may not be super precise : desk 40x33.5x19.5 '' shelves 10x15.5x11 '' drawer 10x2.5x13 '' 
absolutely there is a nice amount of space on the desk top 
black 
no . it has a regular small drawer to the right , and under that one shelve that can be move up or down accordingly . 
no thread count listed on tags attached to the mattress pad . i was not concerned about thread count since a sheet goes over the pad . 
thanks for asking me..i keep it plugged in all year round and it only turns on when you push the button . it will stay on i believe for like 8-10 ( i think 10 ) hours until you push the button in again that turns the light ( on the button ) off . i love love this item ... i know you will too . 
yes 
i do n't really know for sure but i do n't see why it could n't be used on an adjustable bed . 
not to my knowledge . it just has 2 controls for each half . 
we have been useing one on sleep number bed for over 5 years and that just a big air mattres so i would say yes you can 
i have n't washed mine yet , but the instructions say yes it 's washable . i have a duvet cover on mine and it 's great . 
yes 
sure , you can . i preheat the pot on medium heat and cook meat for a few minutes with the cover off to brown . 
yeah i use the base to keep my stainless steel wok pan warm . 
yes . i usually put it on induction cooker to boil , then vaporseal it and transfer to the cookware 360 cooker . induction cookers are not good for slow cooking as they turn on and off instead of continuously heating , breaking the vapor seal . 
there is a seam on the back of the mesh part of the infuser . 
we are so glad that you asked . we are officially starting our launch next week . we will replace the current design and start selling the new one on the week on april 18th . thank you for your patience ! 
dear amazon consumer , yes the product is lead free . thank you for allowing me to be of service to you . kind regards , audrey , consumer relations 
i believe the dinner plates are 9 '' . i have not seen any chips in my dishes yet . 
dinner plate is large & very thick so do not stack well in dishwasher . i 've not been at all happy with set not due to that but how they 've scratched with normal silverware use . do n't waist your money- not worth it . mine are white with a ton of scratched that look a decade old & they 're only a few months old ! very disappointed 
the dishes are white with preferred color accent . my sets just had too many flaws to keep 
yes it can 
i measured and 'unofficially ' the mugs are 14ish oz and bowls are 20ish oz . love the set - very bright and sturdy ! 
hey lenore ; i own this rr set . they are very nice as i like the rustic hand-made look and feel . the dinner plates are diameter 11.125 , and the bowls are diameter 6.25. i hope this helps . 
china i think . 
the cart is 31 high , 18 wide ( add 2 inches for handles ) , and 11 deep . 
we put one tier with an onions bag ( 2-3 lbs ) , we put another tier with a 5 lbs potato bag , and the rest with misc . items . 
6 inches from top of basket to bottom of basket on top of it . 
the box is as long and wide as the 2 end pieces because the shelves need to be put on after arrival . 
must clarify question to receive answer

dimensions : depth ( in . ) :11height ( in . ) :29.5width ( in . ) :11weight ( lbs . ) :4.5 
i did not use this product . the quality of this cart was very poor . after i put it together it needed some way to make it stable . after several attempts at solutions i threw this cart away . i then found a better cart at bed bath and beyond . 
dimensions : depth ( in . ) :11height ( in . ) :29.5width ( in . ) :11weight ( lbs . ) :4.5 
this popper is awesome . it surpasses it 's predecessor for sure ! it 's easier to use ( love the on off switch ) , the hot plate is easily cleaned and is a lot lighter to lift when turning your bowl over . i would highly recommend it . i 'm so happy i did ! great popper ! 
the instruction manual states to use vegetable oil- no more than 3tbl spoons . i use coconut oil 1tbl spoon and 2 3 cup popcorn . popcorn always tastes good-no burnt popcorn : ) 
i just went to west bend site and i do n't think so . i would email them directly . i usually look for bpa free things too . good luck . 
i 'd have to count again but it is either 26 or 28 cupcakes total . works like a dream unless you want candles in the cupcakes . the tiers are a little too close together to get a candle in every one . 
yes it does , simply unscrew each tier 
this is why i love this product , you can use as many or few as you want : ) 
it will hold the big cupcakes 
there 's 3.5 '' between each tier , but because they 're a petal shape , you can position each tier to allow for some more space for the tier above . hope this helps . i love mine and wanted to post pictures from our last party but i could n't upload them .

i do n't know where they are made but you wont be disappointed with the craftsmanship . 
both swivel . 
they are smooth and a little rounded 
yes they are fairly comfortable . they have a good thick padding on the seat and seem to be holding up well . 
yes . probably without sewing . 
my son in law weighs a fit and healthy 190 lbs n 6ft 3in but if leans back the chair backs tips a bit . 
hello lexine , no . a steel base , a standard foundation ( not box springs with coils ) and or a platform bed are all ideal bases to go under the memory foam mattress . the harder the surface , the better the memory foam mattress will perform . 
i did n't measure it when i got it , but i 'd say approximately 65 inches tall and about 12 inches across . 
the mattress is compressed and rolled at the factory so that it can be packed in a box . this allows us to ship the mattress via fedex and it and it also makes it much easier for customers to unpack and move the mattress to their room of choice . 
customers are responsible for the returns shipping cost . 
dear kenneth , thank you for your inquiry . yes your product is oven safe to : oven temperature 350 thank you for allowing me to be of service to you . kind regards , audrey consumer relations 
no , it does not . we have a flat surface cooktop and it stays in place very nicely . 
11 1 2 rim 9 '' actual cooking space 
dear consumer , thank you for your inquiry . yes we do have rachael ray 12 inch deep skillets available , sku 's 77668 , 77666,77667. thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . sincerely , tonia d . 
this particular pan measures 14 '' diameter on the top edges . the bottom surface is approx 12 '' that covers the burner . a nice large pan . hope that helps . 
of course u can just do not use metal utensils . i have fried chicken in it multiple times works great 
yes , that is the type of stove i have and i use it on there several times a week 
this is the best pan i have . it 's maybe 3 or 4 inches deep . 
no it gives support to box spring for the full length of the bed 
the best way is measure frame under the mattress , go to lowes & buy plywood . the lumber department will cut the size you need . this will support the mattress . if you have a regular bed , i do n't recommend using wooden bed slats . they 're lightweight and wo n't support the mattress . 
if it 's a twin size sofa sleeper it will not fit . this is a piece of garbage 
i do n't see why not . they are just a set of slats hooked together with two fibre tape strips . 
yes 
i have been using this bed slats for a month and i would say that they are pretty strong . i bought a mid-beam from ikea for my bed . so , if you use them by installing mid-beam in your bed frame , it will be strong enough to handle any size of bed . i hope that helps you out to make your decision~ 
no and they do not have numbers on them as well . wish i would have purchased wilton . 
on the package it does n't say where at all , so you may have to message the seller . they shipped from swizterland , so maybe there ? hope this helps a bit . i just received them a couple weeks ago and they 're are awesome . very satisfied with them . i read other reviews that the container would n't stay shut . i do n't have that problem or any problems for that matter . i highly recommend them . 
yes , it does . 
most of the tips are n't numbered . only size 1,2,3,18,352 and 3 different star tips , tip for filling cupcakes basically all starter tips . im a beginner but tips for roses , curved tip for daffodils , shell borders , basketweave , fine tip for writing , 3 different leaf tips etc 
no there are no numbers inscribed on them 
i 'm sorry i ca n't help . the set i got had no sizes on them . 
yes but i do not recommend by hand only 
spray 
i do not use box mixed but for a regular recipe from scratch it makes this pan plus two more individual ones.. 
i am not sure what jumbo size would be , but they are pretty large . when i made some and brought them to bible study , we cut the in half ... .i love it . 
this item is available to be shipped to most countries worldwide . 
crib mattress fits in this bed - it is a super cute bed , sturdy , safe and perfect for my son who would n't sleep in a crib after he turned 1 ! 
yes 
basically . there are three boards and a canvas-like lining between the mattress and the floor . 
i really do n't know , but if i had to take a guess , i would say no more than a 80-90lbs child since the two slabs that support the mattress will break probably ! 
no mattress , that has to be purchased separately 
toddlers & up . my son is 3 & it 's perfect for him . 
i weigh 150 and my son is 25 , it does set on the floor so weight isnt a huge deal . 
no , it 's just as pictured ... a creamy ecru color . 
it 's in the ad page but they are : product details color : cobblestone product dimensions : 39.2 x 19.4 x 18 inches ; 49 pounds 
laminate . it does not look like wood . it looks a little cheap to be honest . 
it is more of a gray finish with a hint of taupe . 
i do n't see why not . it 's made of pressed particle board with a laminate . the laminate should cover nicely with a spray can or what have you . 
it is 5 inches in depth and 7 inches in diameter at the top ( internal dimensions ) ; it holds 2 1 2 quarts . 
it is 2 1 2 quarts . 
china 
i dont see why not its stainless steel . 
there are 2 rivets on the inside of the pot for each handle ( 4 total ) and there are 2 rivets on the underside of the lid for the lid handle . 
it is 2 1 2 quarts . 
it is 2 1 2 quarts . 
probably not ( as i could n't find it on the disney store ) , but the tag on mine looked legit . the towel is well done and i have no complaints 
no . this is a cotton blend and not a good quality . 
no , 100 % cotton is not written on the towel . the bottom of the towel does have 'disney frozen ' written on it though . the picture posted for this towel is a picture of the tag . 
it comes with a measuring cup to pour water into the unit . and there is a hot air tunnel , similar to a dryer , and an adjustable window gap fitting . 
great question , frank ! unfortunately at this time , we do n't offer extra long twin sheets . hopefully we should have some to offer you this winter ! 
i do n't think so . ours is only 12 '' deep 
absolutely for curley parsley . i just used mine for the first time and it worked great . i have n't tried it for cilantro or flat leaf parsley yet , but that top hole is small enough that it should work just as well . 
yes . but you sometimes still need to take off the individual stems by hand . 
yes 
yes . i have been trying not to purchase made in china item but it seems that just about everything is . it is a useful little herb stripper though . it works especially well with thyme and rosemary . 
i believe the company is based in seattle , but i do n't know where the product itself is manufactured . i do wish i had heard about this product sooner . it has made my food prep easier when using herbs . 
sorry- not yet . but it works great with rosemary ! ! 
i do not know , have used only for fresh cut herbs . however , having used it , i would think that , if the dried herbs were still on the stem , it would work . 
it is not very large and be aware that it does not have the same texture or colors as the photo posted . 
yes it has red on it 
generally very similar . but of course it 's not a clear print , it 's hand painted , and not by van gogh . 
hi ella , yes , it is already stretched with wood frame on the back , which is ready to hang when you get it . thank you ! lily for accmarket 
14 pieces . 
its wood 
symmetrically-cut , two-dimensional serrated edges for precision slicing stainless-steel blades never needs sharpening full tangs triple-riveted to handles hand wash only limited lifetime warranty 
i purchased about 6 months ago . still sharp but if you do not hand wash they will show spots of rust . 
yes , they are . 
yes they are 
yes , it has english voice commands . great machine 
yes it can make beef stew and chicken soup with the multi cook function . 
you can cook soup and rice and porridge . 
all electronic come with one year manufacturer warranty . thank you 
yes . it works in usa . 
no it does not . but you can remove the inside lid for cleaning purpose . 
according to the manufacturer 's website , this model has dual voltage capability 
no . but they have slow cook mode . i dont know what will you cook . they have a lot of mode . 
this is a mattress and pump ctrls set . this does not include a base . if you 'd like a base please contact us directly and we can help with that . 
yes , as long as you have a queen bed and not a short queen . 
i do n't have the adjustable base , but brochure that comes with the mattress says it will . the controller will automatically compensate . 
yes it keeps the presume right where you set it 
yes . queen bed with 2 side by side chambers . 
we used our box springs with ours worked great 
they are almost as big as a beach towel . they are about 3 inches narrower and about 4 inches shorter than a typical beach towel . but they are much larger than a typical bath towel . 
very . love these towel ! especially after the first wash . 
when you say `` american cotton , '' you are being too general . there is one type of american cotton -- pima -- that compares favorably with turkish cotton . both have long , absorbent fibers that are necessary for a quality towel . according to `` google , '' only about 3 % of the cotton in the us is truly `` pima '' cotton . most of the cotton grown in the united states is a lower grade cotton . i 'm not an expert , but turkish cotton and pima cotton compare very well . just remember , not all towels that claim to be `` pima '' are from american cotton , and very few american cotton towels are 100 % pima . 
hi mary , according to the seller under description it reads 700+ gsm . i personally do n't know the gsm , but went by the seller 's information . hope this helps you . 
it really depends on the size of the tray but it 's one of the biggest microwaves i 've ever owned 
yes it does 
i 'd say about 15-16 inches . it 's slightly larger than average . great microwave by the way . 
it is 19 '' w x 12 '' d x 11 '' h. sits on a 3 1 2 ' round kitchen table and still leaves me plenty of kitchen table space . my 2 slice toaster , napkin holder and a couple other items sit on top of it . my previous micro was 1100 watt , this is 900 watt . i wanted the smaller micro footprint . took a bit of adjusting , time wise , to 900 but it is a very nice , well working micro . 
you need to get in touch with oster to send you another or go to their web site to download one ... .for your model ... ..vince or call 800-324-0340 they should be able to help you ... ... . 
i would get in touch with the company that made it and see if you can get another ... .. or they can fix it ... .for free ... ... it should not stop working in a month or so ... ..they need to make good on it ... or they can send you another one ... ... and you can send that one back ... ... vince 
yep ! it includes all 3 , they are very soft & still holding up well 
one 
i do n't believe it is . it is a standard twin size . 
yes ! they do have deep pockets for thicker mattresses 
i really do not know . i used it for a regular twin . not sure , but maybe it is offered in long 
thank you for the question . whether you need the sheets depends on what you plan on making . anything that is sticky or juicy will require the sheets to prevent things from dripping onto lower layers . for example , if you 're making sweet potato chips and using olive oil , you 'll need the sheets . but if you 're making sweet potato chips and not using oil , the sheets are not necessary . fruit roll ups would require a sheet since they 're sticky and could make a mess on other trays . apricots , on the other hand , not so much . i hope this helps . please feel free to follow up with us at thehealthycornerstore if you want to find out about a specific food you 're thinking about . 
hello , thank you for clarifying the material this item is made of . the entire shell is made of abs plastic . the stainless steel you see are actually stainless steel panels that are inserted into the abs shell , that are more for appearance than function . the dehydrator does include stainless steel trays , and a clear polycarbonate door . if you are looking for a fully stainless steel dehydrator made by excalibur for home use , please see the new model the exc10el , which is quite expensive , however , it is because it is excalibur 's latest design with new doors , and a fully stainless shell case , digital timer , and armored glass doors . regards harvest essentials 
i recommend purchasing dehydrator sheets to prevent them from falling through . there are people on amazon who sell generic sheets that fit the excalibur for dirt cheap . best of luck ! regards , jamaica - the healthy corner store 
thanks for your question . yes , the excalibur stainless dehydrator with clear door does include a 10 year limited warranty from excalibur when purchased from an authorized retailer such as harvest essentials . 
according to the manufacturer 's web site , the stainless steel trays are `` constructed with 100 % 304 stainless steel , 1 4 inch square mesh . '' 304 stainless steel is 18 8 stainless steel ( = aisi usa 304 stainless steel or 1.4301 european standard bsen 10088 ) . when i spoke with the manufacturer directly , they said that both the stainless steel trays and the stainless steel outside panels use `` 5-4 '' stainless steel . i am not familiar with this stainless steel designation , and the manufacturer could not provide any more detail . given that the excalibur web site states that the trays are 304 stainless ( 18 8 ) , it 's likely that the outside panels are 18 8 stainless steel as well . 
so very sorry that i do not know if the unit is made of 18 10 stainless steel . please try to contact excalibur for that type of answer , as it is not mentioned in the description . i can tell you that it is easy to keep clean and i 've been extremely pleased with the purchase . 
made in china , veronica . 
yes but it 's a thin plastic fabric like 
yes it will work . i have a 15 inch memory foam works wonderfully ... 
i have had this for over ten months ( through the hot summer months ) and have had no issues with heat over a memory foam mattress . i did n't get sweaty , so i ca n't answer for someone who has night sweats . 
absolutely not ; and the manufacture makes no such claim . 
no , they do not cool you down when you sleep . 
hi ragie , viscoelastic foam or memory foam tends to give off a smell when new . you can let it air out for a day or two , or you can even go ahead and wash it ( the whole pillow ) if you want to expedite the process . we are constantly using fresh memory foam , and we vacuum seal the pillows to keep shipping costs down which sometimes traps some of the viscoelastic memory foam smell which will disappear . 
hi , no our pillows do not contain pbde 's we manufacture our pillows in california and have some of the strictest bedding laws . pbde has been banned in california . 
this product does have an oder initially . i was concerned , but now it really is not an issue . i ordered another ... good product , good value . 
i do not feel any difference between this pillow and any other pillow as far as how cool it keeps me . i know that in the description they tell you that the bamboo should keep you cooler but i honestly do n't feel any difference . i think that where this pillow stands out is in its extreme comfort - it is definitely more comfortable than any other pillow i have owned . 
kind of . when you push in on it with your hand you can feel clumps of memory foam . it is kind of hard to describe the feeling but it is a pleasent feeling . it is very suddle and when laying on it you do n't feel it at all . 
this comes with the twin sheet set 
no 
not a lot of info with the mach.it all guess work . look at the book nothing was said about the dishwasher 
yes you can . 
yes it does 
i believe you can . almond is not too much harder than soybean . 
i used 1 time to blender very light soybean with water , it was motor burn right the way 
110v 
according to the walmart site , this crock holds 1.3 gallon , about 5 liters . 
no , it does not have a moat for holding water to seal the lid . the inside rim slopes down to the opening . that 's less than ideal for some uses , but better for others . i 'll use mine to ferment korean-style soy sauce over 1-2 years . in that setting , it would not be desirable to have a water seal , because bugs and bacteria would accumulate in the moat , and would drip into the pot each time i lift the lid to sample the fermentation . so for this application , the dry lid will be better , and i 'll cover the top of the closed pot with a cheesecloth and tie it snugly around the rim with twine . 
no , it 's not . the inner rim slopes down towards the opening . 
no . the inner rim of the pot slopes down towards the opening . 
about two minutes from cup to cup . i only make two or 3 a day 
hi , i just purchased the same item as you did , ( i dont have it yet ) .. the bes900xl cerified remanufactured . also in the order description it indicates it as `` new '' . did you ever get any answers of the 2 questions you asked ? and secondly , did your second one work out and meet your expectations ? 
this is item is a polyester and polyester-blend material . 
we are sorry . we do not have one in stock at this time and we are not sure when one will be available . thank you for asking . 
its a little over a foot . 
i do n't see why not . 
it works for our queen size pillow topped mattress and box springs , and the frame is very solid . there is no hangover for the mattress 
no , it is just the metal platform . 
this foundation is not suitable for waterbed . this would be a better option for waterbeds . http : www.amazon.com classic-brands-platform-mattress-foundation dp b00ua62wxw ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1429792905 & sr=8-1 & keywords=europa+platform+bed 
it looks high when you first get it . but , after sleeping on it a few times it goes down . had mine for a couple months now , and it settled to mid way between high and low . 
yes . you can unzip and wash . 
it comes with the bracket . the mounting can be challenging , given the template ( paper ) provided , that you are supposed to hang somehow on the bottom of the upper cabinet . if you had an old ge , you might be able to use your existing bracket ( assuming you are replacing a unit ) . i used mine , it was the same - exactly . the upper holes for the hanging bolts were different - and they need to be right on - very challenging . if you use a laser , it helps a lot to get the alignment correct . 
29 7 8 '' wide x 16 '' high x 15 1 2 '' deep ( plus additional 2 1 4 '' for the handle ) 
the menus are improved . i posted a few pics that should give you an idea . 
yes an aluminum filter that can be washed 
lite in microwave on opening . adjustable lites facing down for cooking on range . 
it seems like the exhaust can be modified but google the manuel to make sure . mine was a standard exhaust up install . 
this is a classic-style foam . it is my understanding that t & n has a special manufacturing process for this kind of foam . it 's not like what i have tried on cheaper foam mattresses , as it 's quite supportive . 
hi laurin , our beds are free of pbdes as well as boric acid . our cotton-bamboo cover is quilted with a rayon blend that is inherently inflammable . this rayon is blended with sand and a small amount of polyester . 
our beds could fit in a futon couch frame if the dimensions are the exact same . however , our beds are not able to easily fold up in half horizontally because of the firmness of the bed . 
6'3 '' x3'3 '' . however depending on your sleeping situation it may feel smaller . mine is on the floor , so it feels a bit smaller simply because i have a large pillow . but if you plan on putting the bed in a frame , then you should be fine . normal twin sized sheets fit without any issues . 
no 
you can place a mattress directly on top of the frame . you can even use a bedskirt in between the frame and the mattress for a nicer look . 
not much just 10in 
i bought it for a higher end air mattress . the mattress has a continuous internal pump to keep mattress filled to optimum . it ( the frame ) is quite sturdy in my opinion . i think it would be fine for regular boxspring mattress or foam mattress . with my queen air mattress sitting atop of this frame , i have to do a mini little hop up to get up onto the bed as the air mattress i have is a bit more in depth than a reg box spring mattress . it is easy to put together , just do n't bend the slats too intensely as they may crack . i followed rule of thumb with the wooden slats as you would with hardwood or laminate flooring , i let it sit and acclimate to apartment temperature for over 24 hours . i think the way the slats curved upwards on both sides allows for more weight . it did give me needed under bed storage for my tiny apt . i am older and disabled and could lift it and put it together , and got needed storage , which was the best selling points for me . 
the poster is 24 inches x 36 inches . hope that helps . it really is a great looking poster ! 
24x36 inches 
24x36 
if you mean the cone shaped melita type filter , then no those will not work with this . while it is touted as having a `` commercial grade permanent basket filter '' so no paper filter is required note that it will accept a standard 8-12 cup basket filter such as is used on mr. coffee , black & decker etc . the bunn sized basket filters are too big . just a regular mr. coffee sized one will work . on mine i get too much sediment using just the permanent filter , your results may vary depending on the grind used . with the paper filter lining the permanent filter inside it makes cleaning the basket much easier also . it is a great coffee maker and makes an outstanding brew . next best thing to a commercial bunn . in fact it has features a bunn commercial pour-over does n't and uses tons less electricity . 
i put both of my thumbs under the little red lever located right above the clock and `` bella '' while placing my index fingers along the top edges of the coffee maker , and it opens with slight pressure . it locks rather securely so it does take a little more pressure than most other coffee makers i 've had . good luck , and i hope this helps even a little . 
when i looked on line i could n't find a replacement carafe here . i would go to the mfg on-line site if you want a red one , but that could be costly . the other alternative is look for one on sale here & by the entire unit . save the base in case the 1st one burns out ( they do n't last forever , but thus is my 1st time buying bella . or go to a bath store & buy a 12 cup regular one . it is the same height as most std 12 cup machines , but you will not get it in red . 
yes it does . 
no 
it 's on a bed in my colorado vacation home so i ca n't measure it as i am currently in texas . this is the most beautiful teal dk turquoise color . the fabric is lovely , the quilted motif is lovely , i 've washed it once and it washed very nicely . i could n't be happier . and it is generous in size and covers the top mattress well . 
sort of they are abstract floral . got them on ebay the green in quilt is one of many in curtians including orange . it looks great 
no . it 's bpa free hard plastic . very durable . 
i just purchased it myself i do n't sell anything sorry . 
probablly in china . it 's a piece of junk ! the lid broke off the very first time i used it ! 
yes , comes with a hex key . you do n't need much more except an extra pair of hands . had no trouble at all , and no parts were missing . 
no 
china 
approximately 1 2 '' to 1 '' . we absolutely love it . very very good quality 
no sorry . i do n't think it will . 
we have a regular queen with another 4 '' thick mattress under this and it still fits really well 
it 's soft & comfortable . it 's a fitted topper about an inch thick . 
the system is highly variable , but to really extend you need to purchase another instance of the system 
this comes as flat panels . you can assemble in multiple configurations . if you do n't include a back panel , you can get as many as 3-4 extra cubes than shown 
i love it 
it 's a cooler green . i would n't call it bright - more like a seafoam green . there 's less blue than green , though so definitely not teal . i hope this helps ! 
depends on text books . but you can put books on it . not sure the measurement 
yes . 25 to 40 minutes depending on how mechanically inclined you or your friends may be . 
product dimensions : 35.3 x 13.5 x 43.9 inches ; 63 pounds 
i do n't know . it 's sort of a thin formica-like veneer over some sort of pressed wood , i 'd imagine . the boards that form the sides , top , bottom and shelves are fairly thick and heavy . very heavy . the 'beadboard ' piece that forms the back is very thin , comes folded -- it looks nice but is not what i 'd call 'wood . ' that said i am very happy with these pieces . i ended up buying 14 of them to do a total makeover in my basement craft room and office and it 's been a year now ; they are perfect for my needs and very roomy and sturdy . whatever they may be made of . 
not neatly , there 's alot of leftover bag . but i use regular bags . you canbuy the fitted ones for not that much more than the regular , but i 'd rather just get them at the store . i did buy the special bags for the small side . i use that side for trash and the big side for recycling . 
it takes their bags which say 35 liters for regular garbage and 18 for recycling . when this first arrived my initial thought was that this simply would not work . with a household of five and two dogs , i thought we 'd be emptying it several times a day . i was wrong . it 's compact on the outside but somehow we pack more inside and actually take it out less often than the standard 13 gal . kitchen receptacles . i did the math and the 35 liter bag converts to 9.4 gallons . i am a believer in this item since owning using it . it stays cleaner as well . i hope this helps . 
dear jeanne , the lid on this unit , which you are inquiring about is black plastic . if you would like a stainless steel lid , please follow the provided link : http : www.amazon.com simplehuman-rectangular-fingerprint-proof-stainless-12-gallon dp b001bvh794 ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1396291355 & sr=8-1 & keywords=cw1830 . best , simplehuman 
yes , a few of them too . oops ! i forgot that i switched sides . i use the trash side ( left ) for recycling and the smaller side ( right ) for garbage . 
yes ! i just checked the bag sizes and that is the approx . size . i have to add that i love this system . i use the smaller side for garbage ( there are two of us and i am glad to get the smelly garbage out more often ) . you do not need to use their bags ( but it nice ) because there is a hole in each container for the knots if you want the bags tight . 
this one has a plastic lid . 1830 has a steel lid . 
no . it has a blue recycle bin that comes out and since you probably will be putting somewhat clean recyclables , no bag is necessary . i just rinse it out when needed . 
sorry , we do n't have it

shelf opening is 13 1 2 '' from the shelf up to the outside edge trim of the table top . from the floor to the under side of the shelf is 19 '' . the shelf does okay with the mixers i use for distillery promotions , but it is n't heavy duty when you look at the amazon photo of the back side of the bar you can see it 's a thin 3 16 '' piece of what i think is probably masonite and not shown is a partial small brace attached to the center underside of the shelf ... it 's not really sturdy enough to be loaded up with tons of mixer bottles . it was made in china and for the price it was affordable enough that we purchased 3 more for distillery promotions . it 's lightweight and quick set-up , it would be perfect for tailgate parties or to throw up for an outdoor bbq . laura the red cup pong bar is nice , but if you 're looking for something a little more high quality . i also purchased an ez-up table though it does n't come with the lower shelves you can purchase lower shelves for the ez-up table from the company who makes the tables ; it 's definitely heavy duty , but unfortunately considerably more expensive and not as lightweight portable as the red cup pong bar . http : www.amazon.com gp product b002vubbxw ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 
yes it does but it all packs up nicely in its carrying case . 
the frame is made of aluminum . the top is made of what i think is pressboard with some kind of coating on the top & underneath . i use mine all the time for distillery promotion at liquor store tastings and i 'm careful to wipe any spills right so the portable bar has held up well . 
in plan view the sides adjacent to a wall are 16 1 2 '' . the short sides project 5 1 2 '' perpendicular to the wall and the front or door side is 15 '' . these dimensions are the out to out dimensions of the trim on the top surface of the cabinet . the inside dimensions are about 2 '' smaller . 
24 '' painted white 
unfortunately the holes are pre drilled and can not be changed . 
mostly wood and some laminate . it 's painted so i ca n't see everywhere that laminate is atop pressboard , but i assembled it , from lots of pieces , most of which were wood . 
you could - but i think you would find the wall cabinet would be rather low . floor cabinet stands 32 '' h - it is meant to hang on the wall at a proper height ! 
back corner to either extremity 
dear hector , thank you for your inquiry . it is recommended to lightly grease and dust with flour , as it will assist the product to release from the pan evenly . thank you for allowing me to assist you with your inquiry . kind regards , audrey consumer relations 
dear ronald , thank you for your inquiry . i have provided the sizes you requested they are as follows : two 10-inch by 15-inch cookie pans with drop zones ; two 9-inch round cake pans ; 9-inch by 13-inch cake pan ; 12-cup muffin pan . thank you for allowing us to be of service to you . tonia d. consumer relations 
literature provided with the bakeware set says handwash only . that being said , cleaning these pans by hand is so easy because nothing sticks to them ! 
i 'm not sure but the person i bought it for loves it and has had no problems . 
yes , it can . my daughter assembled it to her queen head frame without any issue . 
all you need to do is choose the height of your headboard depending on your mattress . the two legs of the headboard have holes for you to put the provided bolt , washer and nut into . it is super easy and takes only a minute . there are two bolts for each side . 
yes 
the product mod-5042-gry has an overall height of 53 '' . 
it 's a tad bit lighter , but i was happy with it . 
i find them to soft . 
hello , this is the price for one pillow . 
hello , yes these pillows are all goose down . 
mine did 
any vacuum pump will work so long as it seals against the black plastic disk seen on the top of the lid . i used an normal electric vacuum pump with a plastic hose held against the disk . does n't take much effort or time as mason jars have a low volume . 
unscrew the lid ring and pry up the lid . 
the wide-mouth thriftyvac mason jar lid ( patent pending ) fits jar sizes 3.375 inches in diameter . the standard size fits mason jars 2.75 inches in diameter . 
they have a hand pump , see the sellers other items 
yes it does . it comes with a kit to install a hose directly to the unit . i have n't installed mine yet but soon will be . this unit has been treated me great . i recomend buying it . 
you may wish to check the specifications , but the size of the room will also depend on the humidity the unit must remove . we have ours in a large unfinished basement area , and it is doing the job quite well . my assessement from a lay perspective is that it will handle a large room or small one-floor apartment nicely . it wo n't handle a house . i would be overkill for a typical sized-bedroom or bathroom alone . 
it has a full one-year parts and labor warranty and a limited 5-year sealed system warranty as well . 
yes it can . it is a bit deceiving but when you press where it says `` timer '' it activates the timer , when you press either of the arrows that changes your desired humidity setting up or down . 
install the diverter tubing that connects the outflow ( that would go into the bucket ) to the internal connection leading to the drain hole . if you do n't have a manual , download from the manufacturer 's site . 
no it doesnt ... . it comes with string laundry bag 
no in a little package 
i think it is but it 's a pretty cheap fabric and maybe not worth it to embroider . 
it is polyester and i 'm pretty sure it can be washed . 
yes it will . i own a gym - mine is used continuously ! if there is a period of inactivity for over a minute it turns itself off to save the battery life . i love mine and so glad i got it . it 's very handy ! 
yes just set it to `` v '' or you can do a combo like on the picture `` bhv '' is beep high + vibrate . 
i have n't dropped it in water or near water to see , but from my experience of using it i find it to be water resistant but probably not waterproof . 
we 've been using this type of grinder for years . it does a great job , but i 'm not sure i could ever tell any difference between this and a burr grinder . 
i only grind a couple of scoops at a time , but it would probably grind about a half cup at a time 
john , i have never tried that , but it might work . it works very well with coffee . 
very easy - i use a soft bristles short handled paint brush ( get it at any art supply store ) 
we are very pleased with this coffee grinder . it is our second one . would recommend it to everyone 
they are large , probably around 18 oz or so ... 
18 ounces 
just over a pint to the brim so about 22ozs 
there are at my daughter 's house , but from my observation they do not cloud up - certainly not as much as another brand we own . 
yes 
yes ... it fits perfect ! not to mention it comes with 12 sample plastic bags too . 
it stays open 
i already had a mount on the inside of the door that the hook mount slid over perfectly . would recommend that design rather than over-the-door to prevent scuffing the door . 
yes , within nominal size variations . this mattress was a little taller and just wider and longer than the original mattress by about 1 2 inch . however the original mattress was a pretty poor piece of junk . camper mattresses are known as short queen or short king , and are about 6 inches shorter than the bed in your house . otherwise they are the same . this mattress is one of the best mattresses we have ever slept on , well worth the price . 
i would imagine you are allergic to latex given your question . it should state in the components what it is made of in amazon site if not call them they are great to talk to hope this helps 
i just used regular queen size sheets and pull them down on the end . it works fine 
you would probably have to ask the manufacturer but i imagine they stay compressed for longer than that before shipping . they are wrapped in air tight plastic so as long as the seal is n't broken i would think it would be ok . 
the mattress is in our motorhome . the base it is on is a piece of plywood , not a traditional base . it makes the mattress firmer . you still sink in , but not as much . so you do n't have to `` climb out '' as you asked . we have another brand of memory foam mattress in our home and it has a traditional base and we had the problem you mentioned . we put a piece of plywood under it and it solved the problem . i hope this answers your question . 
probably because it is a special size order and not a standard size , still worth the extra $ 20 
great mattress my husband and i love it ! very comfortable . . 
not sure of exact weight but it is fairly heavy . i put it in my camper by myself while it was still compressed and wrapped in plastic . once it is unrolled and has expanded to normal size it would require probably require two people to move it . 
i think with a job of that size you 'd be better off to get a larger , more professional machine , even if you have to rent one . 
this is not an extractor 
i do use it on mine , it helps with hard to reach areas and loosens and cleans , it wo n't do it all , of course , you still need to wipe with a clean rag , on hard areas i always dry clean with a soft brush and rubbing alcohol first , then continue on with the steam , be sure the fabric you are using it on will withstand water or steam though . works good for the mats and rugs , still have to wipe and brush of course , but makes the job so much easier and looks so much more finished in the corners and cracks where you ca n't reach . i really like my steamer , use it on most everything , saves my fingers and hands with arthritis . i have a bigger machine also , but i grab this one evrytime unless it 's for a floor . 
yes . it still works the same . 
it 's very cozy now since the weather is quite chilly . i ordered it because it 's supposed to be cooling and until the weather changes i wo n't be able to tell . however , manufacturer info included with the pad does not state it to be cooling . 
would n't see why not . check sizing of your mattress . some dorm mattress are sized different then regular mattress . 
i suppose you could but the mattress pad is built to fit a deeper mattress and may be somewhat lumpy . my mattress is only 9 inches deep and it fits fine . 
i do n't think this company is associated with sealy . at least none of the descriptions or paperwork mentioned sealy . i love the topper though ! 
the skirt on the king size is quite generous . i would check with the manufacturer . i do think they will be very honest with you about it fitting . i do know i love the fact that this pad topper does not shift around . i found that to be a real issue with other ones i have bought . they bunch up under you and it makes for very uncomfortable sleeping . this one doe not do it.. 
you can store it . or , you can pour it in right before serving . 
yes it is lead free , and the picture does n't do it justice ; much more beautiful in person ! 
yes , its lead free . 
sorry ozzie . i 've been out of the country . it is my understanding that this is leaded crystal . a very nice piece and good value , it joins others in our collection . 
it takes type o bags , but you can put in type u. type o are the cloth hepa bags and type u are standard paper bags . 
six feet 
no this model . thank you 
mine came with a 1-year warranty , the usual kind , limited to provable normaluse breakage 
hose is always attached at one end . hose reach is short , sometimes you have to maneuver vacuum to allow a bit more reach . vacuum highly rated by consumer reports and they did mention hose length being short but i never thought it would be a problem . 
if you mean like a roomba , no . if you mean does it have enough power that you just push it ( most of the time ) without feeling its weight -- then yes . 
it says 100 % silicone , so i assume there are no bpas . 
9 '' by 3 5 8 '' on the inside of the pan 
label says china . i 've been very pleased with mine . 
i 'm not 100 % certain jello would n't stick since i 've only baked bread in it . the bread does n't stick , and the pan cleans up easily . i use mine on average 2x a week . a few of the `` tabs '' on the bottom have come off , but that does n't affect the pan part . it would make an interesting jello mold-shape ! 
yes , you can certainly make meatloaf in silicone pans . i usually do n't because the grease sinks to the bottom and it has nowhere to go . other than that , nothing sticks in the silicone and it 's so easy to clean . 
probably ! it would be a gigantic ice brick though . it holds up well against extreme temperatures . 
the price was per piece . if you want seven , you 'll need to order seven . 
no 
they are pretty small . maybe 2-3 inches . but we 'll worth it ! 
there are no modes to change . it just switches between different colors . i would get a few , they are not that bright . 
about an inch and a half . comparably they are slightly larger than a golf ball . i recommend getting a few if you are looking for them to stand out for decorating . 
when you turn it on , it responds pretty much instantaneously , and the readout for weighing items is just about as fast . there is no waiting , in my experience . 
it is made in china 
6 '' wide , 9-1 2 '' long , about 1 2 '' thick . 
mesures in grams kg , oz and lbs . 
a scale cant ... that is volumetric measurement and not weight measured . however water has a density of 1 gram per 1 milliliter . so if you weight out 120 grams of water it is also 120 ml . 
yes . 
when the water gets too low , it ceases to hold pressure high enough to create steam . the indication on the pressure light gets lower ( below 2 ) , but you will also notice that the sound has changed . it is obvious when more water is needed . 
i have , i used the mop brush attachment without the fiber pad . used it to steam sanitize the carpets from fleas . just be sure to vacuum beforehand . 
it works great for that ! 
no but it recommends distilled to reduce mineral build up . if you do n't use distilled water it recommends to rinse out with vinegar on a monthly basis . when i first got the cleaner i used tap water and it still worked great . i recently been using distilled so i do n't have to worry about soaking the tank in vinegar . 
there is a trigger lock button so you do n't have to hold the trigger . 
honestly , based upon the reviews and my previous experience with this product and brand , i would tend to see it as replaceable more than repairable . with careful maintenance ... ... .especially regarding water quality , my last one stayed in good service for 7 years odd regular use . i like the brand because it puts out good volume and is sturdy . repairs would not be easy to find and would likely be more costly than a replacement . i think 7 years of weekly use is a good value ... ... hope that helps . 
i think the blinds would come clean , i used mine on a metal exterior door with 9 panes of glass . it cleaned up wonderfully , even around each pane . i cleaned my stove exhaust also and was quite pleased . as far as the dog bed , it will feel nice . i have cleaned my recliners and couch and they feel clean , but not sure that it is the best way to clean fabric yet . still i love this machine . 
the answer is `` it depends '' . it depends how dirty the grout is . i use it all the time but i still need to scrub to get cleaning done . this is hot steam not a power washer . 
yes we sets of all of our eco mattress bags . we make over 15 sizes and each bag is 20 percent bigger making easier to slide and seal your mattress ! do n't stress about your mattress , we 've got you covered ! 
our eco mattress bag is 2.2 mil , non vented ( meaning no holes ) and is the thickest american made mattress wrap on the market . most bags are 1.8 and 2.0. we designed our bags at 2.2 to take the rigors of moving , storing and of course bed bug protection . please let us know if you have any additional questions ! thanks 
it fit the queen size fine . if you are referring to a twin extra long i would check the length dimension carefully . if it is the same or shorter you will be ok . 
the bag is clear 
hi bobby ! thanks for the question . my eco mattress bag is designed to protect your mattress from bed bug , mite , fleas , ticks and moth infestation . since they can not penetrate me eco mattress bag , as it 's designed as a non-vented 2.2 professional grade recycled plastic ( this is a huge factor ) , bed bugs and other small insects can not enter , break , chew through , burrow or nest like other mattress bags . other mattress bags are usually made with small venting holes which allow bed bugs easy access- which defeats the purpose of protection . our eco mattress bag is also made 15 % bigger so you can pull and seal tight to prevent any bed bugs from entering your mattress . for full protection , i would also suggest to wrap your box spring as bed bugs are commonly found infesting and reproducing in this area . i hope this is helpful and please let me know if you need anymore help ! sincerely green , spencer brown founder and inventor of the eco mattress bag 
no . it is pressed wood particles . 
thank you for your interest in our product . the product that you are inquire for has a weight capacity around ~ 150 pounds . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
thank you for your interest in our product . this bed frame is made of 100 % asian hard wood . thank you and have a wonderful day ! -- furnituremaxx 
i only us hot water and a little detetgent.or a little white vinger kills any order . 
you could but it would n't have the border any more and might unravel . 
yes and very well 
you sure can , though i would n't recommend weighing anything heavier than 4 quarters ( ~22g ) as the limit of the scale is 20g ( 0.70z ) . it 's quite accurate as a compensation , however , you just have to calibrate it and check it with the included masses . hope that helps ! 
technically , this scale weighs in grams for its metric unit . so 1g=1,000mg . so when your scale reads `` 0.055g , '' that 's 55mg . it will not read in `` mg '' directly , though it is accurate enough that you can read for mass in grams to the thousandth-place ( 0.001 ) , which by default is the milligram . it 's just a matter of reading it moving the decimal so that it converts . hope that helps ! 
the tray is removable it just sits on there 
nope , it only takes batteries . 
1 minute 5 seconds 
hello ! this product is made in china . if you have any other questions , please let us know . thank you for your interest , rachel eluxurysupply customer service 
no ( assuming you order the king size ) . i have mine on a pillow top queen , and it fits perfectly ! 
no , i have yet to find any but if you look on west elm ( high priced ) or blowout bedding ( low priced ) they have some interesting ( funky ) patterns that are cool . if you go with the grey pinch , plain white or pastel colors match up well with it . remember the pinch is the focus of the bedroom and you do n't want to have too much of it in the room . also go with a throw blanket and you can change up the color with matching sheets for the throw . regardless of what size bed you have get the cal-king unless you have a twin bed , it looks a lot better touching the floor . i wish i could post you a pic of what i mean . i hope my suggestions help . good day , h 
no , it is a comforter . 
this comforter is pretty lightweight in the sense it is not a heavy , but it is warm . i love this comforter , so i would order it anyway . you could always use it later if you find it to be too warm . 
no . they do n't actually say where they are made but my instinct says 'china ' . 
i bought mine on a lightening deal last week and this is only the second time i 've seen it at this price . check the countdown timer . 
there is no filter per se . you should use distilled or purified water particularly if you have hard water at the tap . there is a cleaning procedure that uses a mild detergent to clean the `` transducer '' in the event it gets dirty which is pretty simple . i have not had cleaning problems ( scale ) using the water i have but the transducer should be cleaned every so often especially before you store it . 
as i recall , it was cool . i do not recommend the humidifier unless you want everything in the vicinity soaking wet ( carpet , any furniture , books . ) , and that is on the low setting . mine is sitting in a box to be used only in a closed bathroom and who needs it when there is a shower there already . 
it says it is ranked for 120 volts which means it is a 110 volt appliance . it is a standard us appliance with a 2 prong plug . i hope this is what you were looking for . 
i have n't tried . i do n't think it is meant for them . it might gunk up the mechanics . maybe if you cleaned it each time but you are probably better off with one meant for them . 
about 4 feet 
yeah , it 's bright . i actually roll up a washcloth and press it on it . it 's really not a big deal but , if it bugs you , you can easily remedy it 
i would suggest not . use a oil burner specifically for that and just use water in humidifier . 
unfortunately i do n't know . i have never used essential oils and do n't know how difficult ( if at all ) they are to humidify . it 's a great humidifier on it 's own though . if oils like that are typically okay to put into humidifiers then i would guess it 's okay . 
not heavy , but does not fold up well -- -more like `` l '' shape . otherwise is a good floor product if your bottom is not big 
hi michael , the dimensions are l : 21.5 '' w : 14 '' h : 6 '' inches at it highest ( where the bottom of the chair folds up which is about a quarter of the length of the chair when folded ) and less than an inch in height for the rest length of the chair when folded . it comes with a stury plastic bag that it fits into nicely . hope that helps . 
yes . the cover has a zipper and can be taken off to wash . 
i would recommend it . the bed is pretty high and the platform frame is pretty strong . my kids have jumped on it and it holds both of them . 
yes 
no you ca n't there is one metal bar on the bottom . 
it 's bright white . 
yes it is but i wouldnt consider for an adult because is very light . it might last less than expected . i sleep there sometimes but my weight is aprox 127 lb not so heavy ! 
it 's the same desk pictured . 
back of desk is not finished . it does look nice when put together . 
i bought the desk for my daughter in virginia . she does crafts and she thinks the table is perfect for her . 
not solid wood , but it 's nice 
no , this is how it look like . 
no 
i do n't think so . the right side with the lower shelf is shorter than the left side where the drawer is . the grooves are designed in specific spots to fit what is in the picture . 
yes i think they will work for that . for there size they are real strong . 
not sure what you mean by `` on fabric . '' if you use them to attract a metallic object like a political button through a sweatshirt then yes they are strong enough . 
unfortunately not . when i built it , the instructions and everything was designed for the bookcase to be on the right side . 
yes it is . but careful the last you want to install it should be the sliding glasses . costumer service is excellent if you need any replacement or help . 
i had thoughts of doing the same thing but the glass cabinet only has the pre-drilled holes on the top to match the photo setup . you could put the glass cabinet on the left if you were okay with having the top part of the desk just sit on ( not be screwed into ) the glass cabinet . i was n't , so i have it setup as seen in the photo . 
the upright black pieces that hold the shelves are wood . the base and top appear to be an engineered wood product with a black plastic laminate . 
i purchased this item a couple months ago . yes ... . all 4 sides are glass . 
not too hard . took about half an hour . certainly would be easier having some help . i did it by myself . i 'm comfortable building things so doing it myself was n't a stretch for me . if you 've put together ikea- type furniture , then this would be very similar . 
16 3 4 '' w x 14 1 2 '' d x34 '' h 
hi - just took a tape measure to one glass shelf , 9.5 '' x 15 '' is length width 
it is a glass curio ( display case ) 
no , there seems to be no gap . 
not really sure . possibly a thin fiberboard , but it 's covered with a hard formica-type finish , so it 's hard to tell . i must say though it 's very sturdy and not heavy ... maybe 25-30 pounds ; real wood of that sturdiness would be heavier . when i ordered it , i thought it may be a bit rinkey-dink , but upon opening the box , was surprised at the quality . i love this thing . tons of out-of-the way storage . if you 're going to buy one , make sure you have at least 3.5 inch space between the center of your door 's hinge pin barrel and the wall . 
the way it is designed you would not be able to mount it on the wall without customisation 
the cabinet is made of mdf ( medium density fiberboard ) , which is a wood composite material that is very strong . it is much stronger than particle board , which can be flimsy . i own multiple units , and they are very sturdy . 
you can fully open the door without any problems ! 
9.6 '' x 15.2 '' & 7.3 '' high 
i have been using mine for three months and no rusting so far . 
product dimensions : 9.6 x 15.2 x 7.3 inches ; 2 pounds this is right from the product specs on the page 
yes 
it is off white or , yes , oatmeal . 
both the legs and writing are black . 
they are coming together . 
it is 22 inches . we find keeping a throw pillow for your back is more comfortable . 
yes 
unfortunately , i do not know and i do not remember reading any number related to weight limit . a 200 pound guest has sat in it and it did not break . not sure how long it would last with such weight . 
i have it in a spare room to read a book . it is comfy and yes your feet does touch the ground . it is very light so when we have company one person can carry out to living room with no problem . 
as is , no ! there were no provisions for tubing or anything else that might be needed for a continuous drain . 
no provision for a wall mount . so no . 
as a dehumidifier it is a nice medium sized unit . as far as an odor product maybe leave out some air freshness that just work off of water like the kind with the mini scent balls . 
i can hardly hear it running . its whispers . ( quiet ) . i have to feel the sides to see if it 's still running . 
yes 
no 
9-1 2inches tall 
it 's crap . in other word 's do n't waste your money . the first one they sent had a broken piece and the screw on leg 's were uneven . they sent a second one at no cost but it 's made in china and is cheaply made . get something made in the us . hope this help 's . 
dear valued customer : thank you for your email . please note item # 97003 , `` tapestry stool '' weighs 4.4 lbs . if you have any further questions , please feel free to contact us again . thank you for contacting collections etc . on amazon ! 
measures 15 1 2 '' l x 11 '' w x 12 '' h . 
at the gilt web site ( once you have an account , search `` gourmet fork '' or `` gourmet knife '' ) , but the knife looks rusted in the picture . i have not ordered . also , an internet search for `` replacements boda nova gourmet '' : over there they sell at an exorbitant price , and the measurements for most flatware does n't match with what amazon sells and the pictures are a lot less shiny , so may not be identical . 
no , the box states made in vietnam 
no 
yes some but the only way to escape that would be if it was mesh lined . 
about 16 inches or so 
i mean if you like a big old sticker on a bottle like that , by all means keep it . 
maybe ? i put it in the dishwasher a few times & it did well . 
i assume so but i have n't tried it . would recommend top rack only . 
dimensions are 13.0 '' h x 9.8 '' w x 13.3 '' d according to the keurig site : http : www.keurig.com brewers elite-brewing-system 
there are 3 different cup sizes , but the small cup is very small . i believe it is only 8 oz . i 'm not where i can look at it and have only had it for a very short time , but i use the middle setting for my cups at home because they are bigger than 8 oz . i have n't used the large size yet . 
see here . ... for cartridges ... .. http : www.waterfiltersfast.com 5-micron-polyspun-sediment-filter-25-x-10_p_1960.html 
there are four straight dividers and one x shaped divider . 
no 
my lids have handles but they do n't sit well . the unit is not very logical either if your lid does n't fit exactly it will fall through and to put lids back in you have to take them all out and put them back in size order which it a pain . kind of like a soda holder , when you take one out all the rest push forward . 
i think so . each ring comes out about an inch or so . 
i just measured mine and it was 17 '' x 11 '' but yes that should be right . 
no but it works great . 
pans are fully lined inside with ceramic , and have a spiral aluminum bottom when you turn them upside down . the outer sides are a lovely green color . 
as copied from product description on the product page on amazon.com : product description what 's in box : 10 piece cookware set includes : covered dutch oven 5-quart , covered casserole 3 quart , covered sauce pan 1 quart , covered sauce pan 2 quart , fry pan 8 inch , fry pan 9.5 inch fry pan . nonstick ceramic coating is ptfe-free , pfoa-free , cadmium and lead free , compare to traditional nonstick coating system , ceramic coating provide superior non-stick performance with resistant to scratch . cookware use thick gauge aluminum provide super heat conductive without any hot-spot in bottom , anti-slip coating on handle provide a soft feeling when touch handle , make it comfortable and stay cool during cooking . 
it you choose prime it takes 2 days . i got my set quite a while ago , before it was prime , i think and even then it took just 3 days or so to get it . 
no , these pans are not anodized , they have ceramic interiors . i gave my daughter a set for christmas and she says that they are the best pans she has ever owned ! and she has gone through a lot of pan sets over the years . 
i have a glass stovetop and they work great . they have an inlay of metal on the bottom to assist in heating . 
we are very sorry to inform you that we do not sell it separately . 
yes 
i own one and it is definitely taupe 
completely sewn on , unfortunately . i carefully cut it off and because both the box and the label are black you ca n't really see anything 
13 '' x 13 '' 12 '' deep 
no . the lid is not attached . 
probably . the quality was not that good . the stitching came out in a short period of time . i did n't leave it on my bed two months ! 
my bedskirt is 15 inches long . 
i love love love love my comforter ! it is just as pretty in person as it in the picture . however , if you are hot nature you will not want to sleep under it . it 's very toasty ! 
i would dry clean it . 
sauder does not reccomend that you paint any of their models . it would void the warrenty . 
w12 ' x h 13 ' 1 4 x d 11 ' 1 2 the cubbies have decorative planks on top and at the bottom that are sticking down and up by 1 2 ' . 
no , the shelves are tall enough but they are only 11.5 '' deep . 
52 '' w , 45 '' 1 2h , 12 '' d 
it is that dense cardboard that you typically tack on the back of shelves like this . 
53 1 8 '' wide , 12 1 8 '' deep and 47 1 2 '' tall 
anyone who thinks the interior is all steel did not look carefully at all . r. roebuck is correct . i just received my kettle an hour ago , and while the bottom of the inside is steel the sides inside are entirely plastic . it 's a bit hard to tell because they try to make it look like steel , but after 10 minutes of testing i am 100 % sure it 's plastic ( different sound when tapped , different temperature than the steel bottom , etc ) . avoid this kettle if you do not want plastic touching your water . 
good question ... because i was wondering the same thing when i bought it . my last kettle was so loud , that my family would make me turn it off when they were trying to watch tv . this kettle is very quiet , and the whole family is happy now ! the only thing we had to get used to is that when it finished boiling it has a nice little chime that sounds exactly like our doorbell . it took a few days before people stopped running to the door when the kettle was finished boiling . 
yes 
i read reviews on both and they seem to be equal in quality . the question would be if nutriteam as a company stands behind its product - in terms of customer service , repairs etc - ike tribest does . otherwise i do n't see a difference . i personally would still prefer my tribest red and black one because of the high quality customer service at tribest . 
greetings ! yes ! : ) i 've `` juiced '' coconuts many times . absolutely delicious ! crack open the coconut , drain the water in a blender ( i have a vitamix ) ... .make sure the water is clear , not cloudy . crack out pieces of coconut , put in blender with coconut water , rough chop blend . feed into the tribest and watch as the milk pour out . yummy . i freeze the dry pulp in ice cube trays and use when blending smoothies ... .great fiber . i absolutely love my tribest . the banana and peach `` ice cream '' is amazing . i keep frozen fruits in the freezer to make the ice cream or sorbets . hope this helps . 
vertical auger juicers are `` adequate '' but not the best to juice wheatgrass . i have juiced wheatgrass in this machine and it does fine . but i '' m not juicing wheatgrass only , i 've combined wheatgrass with other ingredients . for this purpose it does well . if your looking to juice mostly or strictly wheatgrass i would look at the horizontal auger style juicers ie : omega 8006 or buy a dedicated wheatgrass juicer . if you looking to juice wheatgrass as well as other fruits and veggies then this does a good job . hope this helps 
yes . i put almonds in it to make almond milk . i just have to add them in with water . if you want to make nut butter you 'd have to use the mincer attachment . 
if you clean this unit as soon as you make the juice you want ( i.e . before things dry on it ) it is super easy . rinse in water and use the brush on the fine metal filter and that 's it ! i adore this unit . i have juiced everything from beets , to carrots , to spinach . it 's an amazing unit and it gets daily use with no problems at all . i also use the other attachment to make shaved ice . that was a life saver during chemo . 
with the tribest sw-2000-b slow star juicer you use the mincing attachment to make nut butters . the mincing attachment uses the auger and not the screen . when you run nuts through the machine with the mincing attachment on , the nuts will come out almost powdery the first time through . you may want to run the nut ingredients through up to 5 times to get a creamy consistency . the more you run the nut mixture through , the creamery it gets . you also may want to add a little neutral tasting oil to you nut butter to increase the creaminess . many commercial nut butters have added oil . the oil can be added when the nuts go through the machine or after you are done running the nuts through the machine . i hope this information helps you . veggiesensations 
it really depends on the type of food you are juicing . if you are not doing leafy greens , the tribest may be better for you . it is faster than a horizontal auger juicer and adds versatility with its spout plug and its mincing attachment . to order please click on `` see seller 's offer '' below . 
it is made to hold bottles of glitter glue ie , stickles , stampin up , ranger distress stickles . if your paint bottles are the same size it will probably work . 
you can make long and short spiral strips . it 's easier to get spirals out of the zucchinis while the carrots spiral is a bit harder because it 's a much firmer vegetable 
that depends on your frame . is it open without internal supports ? how large the inside dimensions are . look at the size description on the frame info . i believe it is roughly 735411.5 inches . it is designed as a stand alone or could be used as internal frame for your futon as long as your other frame is fully supported on its own . 
the bed frame does not squeak ... and i have used two mattresses on it . 
i 'm 120 , and it holds me just fine 
i had a couple break on me too . i contacted the company from the manual . they needed to see an image so i took a photo and sent them an e-mail with the information . i received replacements in the mail a few days later after communicated with me on the issue . i 'd make sure to list how many are broken . i got one more than needed so i kept it as a back-up in case another breaks . 
no 
from my own unit it does n't look like it would properly support rollers casters for the frame . the frame itself is fairly light weight to be moved when needed . having rollers casters on the frame would probably make it more likely to move when you do n't want it to even when locked in place . if the company makes rollers casters for this frame specifically i have not yet seen them available . i have n't found it difficult to move the bed itself when needed though , which is rare as there is already a fair bit of space below to vacuum under the bed without moving the frame . 
no it ca n't 
julian , i purchased this comforter a month ago and if you are looking for something breathable this is the one to get ! not too heavy or hot at all . very well made . you will be happy with it ! might i also suggest you look at getting bamboo sheets . after much research , we also purchased this at the same time and i could not be happier with the quality and results . the sheets feel like satin and keep us cool all night . apparently they have a wicking property that lets heat escape . still have n't found a pillow that actually works yet in keeping my head from getting too hot . ( i 've tried them all ! ) 
it fits nicely ! 
comforters are thick , filled blankets that usually have a decorative design printed on them directly . they are meant to be placed over bed linens . duvets tend to be plain white and more thickly filled . they are intended to either replace a regular comforter altogether or to be an extra cover on top of a regular comforter . removable and washable duvet covers can be purchased to add decoration to plain duvets and protect them from dirt . 
yes , the one i bought on 1 19 2015 does indeed have the corner tabs for securing a duvet cover . based on the other comments i was expecting to have to sew some on myself . so the fact that mine has the tabs was a pleasant surprise . 
sorry it does n't 
yes . 
i have n't tried it on a serrated knife yet . but it works great with standard edge 
yes , it will work with just about any type of knives . 
i use it with all my knives . you will love it . 
we use ours for about 800 sf and it works very well at medium . 
have always used cold tap water , but i would think distilled water would be better , and yes it would last longer , and you may not need to clean as often . 
i have n't , but i did n't read a warning against it in the manual . 
since you ca n't use cleaners i make sure i clean every other day with paper towels and the provided brush for the silver disk . once you have a build up i do use a soft brush on the white plastic parts , , but not on the silver disk . they sell an additive for hard water build up , which may be your problem . i hope this helps . 
how loud is the gurgulling ... .mine is just about heard 
couch width is 22 inches bed form 42 inches arm of the couch are 32 inches cheers 
it 's poorly made futon that 's going to break down on you . do not buy ! 
i really thin polyester . after 3 months it ripped and the wire from the inside of the couch is showing . 
not exactly sure but i would say about the same length as a sofa 78inches 
it fits an ipad well and it measures 5-1 2 '' x 5-1 2 '' , nothing larger . do not have a kindle paperwhite . 
it does not hold an ipad air securely because the ipad air is so thin . 
ana : thank you for your question . at the moment , we offer this pillow in both gray and burgundy . scott 
yes 
thanks for your interest , this item is not available for shipping to australia . the best way to check if an item can be shipped to your address is to add the item to your cart . if you are able to proceed to checkout , it means the seller does ship to your address . if not , you will receive an error message notification . you do not need to purchase a product by adding it to your cart . if you do not want to purchase it , simply remove the item from your cart . i hope this helps ! 
yes it does , i am typing on my ipad mini that is on a gogo pillow right now ! it will hold an ipad mini or a regular ipad and a kindle fire , i have all of those . 
it 's got a larger feed chute , different auger , better recipe book , more accessories , etc 
there are about 5 or 6 parts to clean . everything is easy but the pulp basket and pulp chute . the basket has a special 'basket tool ' to make it pretty easy to clean . you 'll need a long dental tool or similar thing to pull out the pulp that remains in its little chute . all in all , it 's not too bad . i just rinse everything well right after juicing . and i do n't use soap often at all . let it all drip dry . 
this juicer is the us model in 110 volt 60 hertz . it can not and should not be used on 220 volt 240v 50 hz with any sort of converter transformer as it will void any warranty , and will cause premature wear on the motor . an international model of this juicer is not available for sale from a us source at this time . 
yes . 
i have 10 large mugs on mine . there are 5 more hooks on the bottom , but you ca n't really hang mugs on them . 
no it 's sturdy . 
it does n't hold deep wine glasses very well , but shallow ones are okay . 
surely you jest ! it 's made primarily for mugs and such , so i hardly think since mugs may be wet , the company would hardly make the stand of something that would rust , especially at 40 bucks a pop ! the answer is no ~ it wo n't rust ! maybe if you leave it out in the rain a few years ... .. 
yes 
it has a powder coat on it , so i think you 're pretty safe . i would n't dry wet cups on it though , just to be safe . 
the prongs are only 3 '' long . i have some tall beer glasses ( 10 '' high ) that i would n't trust on it . a glass that measures 6 '' high fits well enough , that is probably the tallest glass i would feel comfortable placing on it . in order for the glass to not fall off , it must rest against band and the taller glasses do n't rest well . the taller the glass , the less sure i am that it will stay on . wine glasses will only `` stay '' on in certain spots . overall , i just do n't feel comfortable placing taller glasses on it so i really have n't used it that much . trying to come up with an alternate use for it . 
it should . have n't tried it . 
i use 2 of them under my king mattress that sags and they do n't really work . mattres still sags a lot and it was n't worth the money at all ! ! i would n't recommend them , but have n't been able to find anything else , and researched a lot . everyone told me to get a new mattres the sag thing is it 's only 4 years old and we 're not heavy people . again , i dont recommend them 
each section is about 5 inches wide and 3-4 inches tall and does take out the sag of my mattress . i 've tried other remedies and this the best one so far for me . hope this helps you out 
mattress helper was not designed for a sleeper sofa , so it may be hard to say if you can leave the mattress helper in the sleeper sofa when you fold it up . it would depend on how much space remains in the sleeper sofa when the mattress is folded into it . this is not to say that mattress helper wont work under a sleeper sofa mattress but to leave it under the mattress inside the couch may not work due to space . 
i have a full size bed and bought one 31 inch and one 20 inch which fits perfectly 
i would recommend that for the california king that you purchase two of the 31 '' x 50 '' mattress helpers and place them between the mattress and box spring in the area that is too soft or is sagging . for the extra length of the california king mattress , you might decide that you need the mattress helper mini add-on which you use in addition to the mattress helpers for extra length and a level bed surface . we will be offering this mattress helper mini to our amazon listing within the next week . thank you for your interest in mattress helper . 
i do n't know about a twin size , but even two of the big size ( shipped in the same box ) , was probably 6-8 pounds at most . and that was 2 boxes inside a bigger box . they 're made out of foam , so are very light . 
yes , absolutely . we have many customers who have used mattress helper on this type of memory foam mattress and are quite happy because of it . purchase 2 of the 20 '' for full coverage under your mattress . thank you . 
it holds about a gallon . 
it holds about a gallon of water . 
# 2 is fixed at 30 '' ... # 1 is adjustable from 14 '' to 19 '' 
the dimensions are 19 '' ( width ) x 11 .5 '' ( depth ) x 71.25 ( height ) . 
19 '' 
it is 11 & 3 8 inch deep 
they are actually the same item , so there is no difference . 
i believe it was just a screwdriver and a hammer 
yes , definitely . it 's a very sturdy bookshelf . 
the actual size of the bookcase is : 71 inches tall ; 19 inches wide and 11 1 2 inches deep . this is the actual , literal size of the bookcase . i like it , it 's pretty sturdy . the back of the bookcase is basically cardboard however , but it does match in color . 
this is very sturdy and well made not flimsy at all so yes is my answer 
in my opinion no . the material of the wood probably wont hold the paint on there 
i used a drill slowly so it would n't damage the wood but you can use a screwdriver too . it could take more time and it might make your wrist hurt after a while . you also need a hammer to nail the back wall . overall , it was n't difgicult at all . it may be a bit heavy to place the pieces together but i was so excited to finish that i went for it by myself . if you have an extra hand that would be nice but not necessary . 
i use it for books but it could hold at least 130 front faced dvds . you could lay some on side on top of the others and add more . 
12 '' x 18 '' x 72 '' 
from the inside bowl it is 10 inches and from handle to handle it is 13 inches . hope that helps . : ) 
no they are slightly flat on the bottom 
a i 4 inch drill bit fits snugly into one of the holes 
i think just that if there are pictures of books , decorative pieces , etc . in the advertisement that those items do n't come with the bookcase . 
to tell the truth i was given no instruction on how to assembly it , i used a phillips head and a small hammer . and good luck getting any help from the company . as to the product it is great and for it i have no complaints 
19 '' 
you can leave the spout open so it does n't whistle . i 've found that the whistle is not very loud to begin with though . 
i would assume so but do not know for certain 
yes , it does work well on a gas stove . it 's used daily , and has held up well . 
i 'm afraid i do n't know the answer to this question as i sent it back . the kettle is very lightweight and cheap , so i went with the paul deen one instead . 
hi , this item will not fit your model . we do stock the correct part but it is not currently listed on amazon . we will hopefully get it listed shortly . kind regards alan @ selectric 
hi , could you please confirm the model number on the base of your vacuumcleaner . it should start with an s. thanks 
they should work - but you may need the torsion spring too 
hello , unfortunately we do not carry the required part is our stock . kind regards , customer services spares4appliances t : 0872 410 7011 e : sales @ spares4appliances.co.uk w : www.spares4appliances.co.uk 
hello , unfortunately our technical team is not available this week . please feel free to resubmit your enquiry next monday . we are very sorry for any inconvenience caused . kind regards s4a 
lol , i did n't know for sure so i timed it for you - 3 mintues ... 
the smallest amount it will weigh is 0.1oz or 1 g 
no issues with rubber feet . i keep it stored on its side when not in use . 
6 in . by 9 in . by 1.2 in . thick . tells you exactly on the product page in amazon . 
the label on mine says made in china . 
it is 11lb or 5kg 
10th . 
yes , it does . it offers pounds and ounces , grams , milliliters , and fluid ounces . 
no but it will hold the display reading so you can still tell the weight . 
no it does n't measure under a gram . 
full queen size is 90x90 inches , and king calking size is 106x90 inches . 
if you 're able to use your home or commercial washing machine that will work . when drying use a clean tennis ball in the dryer to fluff it up . i like to hang it outside then put it in the dryer . 
these down comforters are made in only white . but we have over than 200 duvet covers in solid , stripe , printed and in many different fabric and you can use to cover this comforter . please check our amazon storefront for these duvet covers . 
no it does n't . i held the corners as i put it in the duvet cover . just working slowly it filled up duvet cover easily . 
full queen size is 90x90 inches , and king calking size is 106x90 inches . 
it says 100 % natural down on thelabelake it does not say goose 
no , but they are pretty sharp for table knives . 
no 
the only imprint says gorham or gorham 18 20 . 
yes 
there are 12 teaspoons and 12 soup spoons , plus my set also included a couple of serving spoons . 
hmmm , no definitive answer on that . i 've slept on a futon so i know what you 're talking about . i 'm on a seraphina 14 inch gel foam mattress so i 'm super comfy . my inclination would be to add a foam gel topper to your futon over this product . 
it 's the same fabric as traditional box springs . it 's a tight fit and challenging to get centered but it works well once you get it on there . 
yes 
80 '' 60 '' 
a socket wrench or adjustable wrench and a philips head screw driver . 
yes 
it can be washed , just wash it in cold , on the delicate setting by itself . i hang mine dry . this pillowcase is really cute and worth the price , i 'm very pleased with mine . : ) 
we will ship it in 1 business day after the payment is clear , at the same time , we will ship it via ems , it will take 5-15 days to arrive at you.thanks . 
hello dear friend , thank you for your interest in our item , but i am so sorry that we do n't have it in 24x24 the moment . hope to do nice business with you next time~best regards 
yes , it is . 
todava no los he lavado 
i would say 5-6 inches in diameter and 2-3 inches high . it is small and very helpful . hope this is an answer . 
i purchased the etekcity professional 22lb 9310 model scale and it 's powered by two aaa batteries and has an auto shut off . no power cord . 
just put the object on the scale then turn it on . 
after re-reading the directions , the information on the box , there is no indication of a warranty of any kind . 
about 4.5 inch diameter . i use a plastic container to hold larger quantities and zero the scale with the container , works great ! 
takes 2 aaa comes with it . 
well put it on a sturdy flat surface . wobbly surfaces can cause subtle movement in the material being weighed , especially the surface plate . once it is still it should settle to zero if it does n't , then hit the tare action and that will re zero the scale . the directions should tell you on how to operate the tare function . 
27 x 40 
it comes rolled up in a card board tube . 
yes , a short hose with a male hose connector comes with the unit . you slide the hose thru a provided hole onto the drain tube and connect your hose to it . 
yes . comes with filter . 
yes . i 've washed mine just under water . 
yes , a drain hose found at your local hardware store can be used . 
yes . it will turn back on and run until it reaches the desired level again or until the resevoir is full . 
90 days labor and 1 year parts . 
no 
set up of the unit is very easy . you unbox the unit , remove the drain tube from the water catch bucket , plug it in and set the humidity level where you want it and hit run . it will run until either the bucket is full or the unit reaches the humidity level you set 
yes 
at 9.0 that is a good alkaline level . the filter should be change every 3 months . also clean your pitcher every two weeks . 
from the same site that sold the pitcher or just google filter for the pitcher of life alkaline water 
we use only reverse osmosis water in our pitcher and it makes the most smooth tasting water ! we love it ! 
you can and should use the alkaline water for all water to be consumed , but you might not want to do all your water at once if you are still just starting use of alkaline water as it can clean you out rather abruptly . 
the pitcher does come with one filter included . 
stripes are black.. very nice shower curtain i love it ! 
hi my name is dina and i actually brought the leopard print bathroom shower curtain and also the bathroom leopard rugs , and to get to the point the color of curtains are leopard and the rugs are also leopard . so their really beautiful , hope that help , if u have any other questions you could email me at dlefort85 @ gmail.com 
19 '' x 30 '' i have one . 
i guess about 15 x18 . it is pretty but slips all over the place . needs some kind of grip stuff underneath 
it is machine wash & tumble dry . i do n't know how well it will fare however . it 's a pretty rug , but is not holding up well to every day use . 
yes it does . 
yes , you need to move the bottom tray but it fits fine . i usually make two cups of coffee on the middle setting and there 's still room for milk cream . you may have to pour out a tiny bit , but they are wonderful . tip it upside down and not a drop comes out . also , keeps the coffee hotter than most . 
the inside of the lid is hard to clean . so , i put mine in the dishwasher . eliminated the problem . hubby loves the cup . 
no . they are stainless steel . 
you can buy them separate , but this one comes as a set of 2 
screws on . it a very good travel mug , i very highly recommend it ... 
i do n't know for sure , but it looks like it is stainless steel . i know they wear well . we have some that we have had for years & they look as good as the ones we just bought . 
china . these are great mugs and contigo stands behind their warranty . had one for more than two years and it developed a small leak after many uses . contigo replaced the top at no charge . very impressive product and company . 
there are about 18 hooks of various shapes and sizes . 
yes 
no , not even close . the actual boards are less than an inch deep . when using the longest pegs , they might be close to that . 
hi maria , thank you for your interest in this item . the panels and roughly 20 hooks , none of the cooking accessories are included . thanks , susan 
to me , the item does not appear to be designed for outside installation . 
yes , but you would need to buy your own installation hardware from a local hardware store . the installation hardware included with the panels is only for wood or drywall , not concrete . the blue tapcon screws designed for concrete work well in concrete blocks . 
it does not come with a straw . i bought glass straws . 
i have stainless straws and they fit . they are thinner than traditional straws , but the hole would be big enough to fit as big as traditional plastic straws . smoothie type straws would be too big . hope this helps ! 
this is sold as a `` one pack '' , one per package . 
usa all the way . the design was originated in cambridge massachusetts i believe 
http : www.amazon.com gp product b00ajg5e1u ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00 ? ie=utf8 & psc=1 i also ordered the smoothie straws and they are fine ... 
no , not at all . 
it is really a j. when you see the mold in person you can see the difference better . 
yes , it is food grade . please be note , the finished size is about 1cm ( 0.39 inches ) . they are small size . sincerely , seller : allforhome 
hello , the finished fondant letters are small size , about 1cm ( 0.4 inches ) . sincerely , seller : allforhome 
hello ralch , the finished letters are small size , about 1cm ( 0.4 inches ) , sincerely , seller : allforhome 
good question . it is okay to fill the cups 1 4 or 1 2 full , or even leave them empty . you will not hurt the product in any way . happy baking . 
yes . that is primarily why i bought mine . i have frozen homemade veggie broth , spaghetti sauce , sloppy joes just to name a few . makes it very easy to pop them out and store in a freezer bag ! 
outside dimension is 1 17 16 '' or just short of 2 '' 
it 's silicone , so yes , it 's flexible bends . 
i do , it 's easier to pop them out . 
testing for `` white steaks '' is not a valid test . over 90 % of the earth 's crust is composed of silicate minerals , making silicon the second most abundant element in the earth 's crust ( about 28 % by mass ) after oxygen . [ nave , r. abundances of the elements in the earth 's crust , georgia state university ] . silicone in its natural pure form is white silver light gray , but can have traces of other colors . if you google around , you can verify this . i would put a link here , but amazon does not allow links outside of their website domain . if you see white ( or could be light gray or silver ) when you contort ( severely twist ) any silicone product , you are just seeing the raw materials used in the product , which is a good thing .

i 'm sure you could , i have not tried , but i ca n't think of any reason they would n't work . 
there should be a link , a website , or simply the product company on the cardboard wrapper . check the back , too . go to the website and look for a way to register products . 
i believe the bags would hold the seeds . they are a very fine mesh . 
mesh is a good description or it can be described as a very fine soft netting that you can see through . 
yes , it has a pot clip . initially , i could n't figure out how to use the clip and here 's the secret . pinch the clip together near the probe holes . guide your probe through the holes to the length you want , then release . the probe is now locked into the clip until you release it . easy ! 
i 'm not sure what their official stance would be , but i would say `` yes . '' the probe they package with the chefalarm is rated to 572f , and short-term exposure all the way up to 700f . i 've certainly never had any issues with probe failures that seemed to be secondary to heat ( at least , not with thermoworks probes ) . having said that , i usually recommend purchasing a second replacement probe just in case ; repeated kinking at high temps *can* cause issues even with the best probes , and it can be really annoying to be stuck without a usable probe at the wrong moment . 
there are instructions that come with it . a small booklet but it explains everything . 
yes it does . 
the probe is six inches long on the straight part with another 1 2 inch when the 90 degree bend is included .

hi matt , yes , the very center of the holding tank is higher , conical shaped , so that the honey gravitates towards the outer perimeter . if you have any other questions please feel free to email us or call us directly monday-friday 8am-4pm pst @ 1-866-425-4693. sincerely , customer service secco international inc. 1-866-425-4693 
yes . 
not in front of it but going to say less than 2 inches and closer to 1inch . i use a cake icing tool to scrape down the inside sit a bowl on the floor , tilt the extractor over after it drops below the lip and scrape out the last bit . 
i have only tried 3 frames and it worked well . 
hi gary . we usually stock both . this listing here , as the title indicates , is a 3 frame . if there is anything else that we can help with please feel free to email us or call us directly monday-friday 8am-4pm pst @ 1-866-425-4693 . 
no problems with my packaging . all was there . 
yep . you should contact the company . they 'll probably mail you some . i 've had good luck getting parts for large items like this and it typically comes very fast . look for a piece of paper that says something along the lines of `` do not return to store if parts missing . '' it usually has the contact info you need . 
it is quite sturdy . not too soft . very firm . 
no , it 's as wide as a queen bed so it would not attach to anything and the legs would show . 
yes , it 's made with fabric . and it looks very elegant . 
i 'm sorry but the headboard i assembled is not currently at my location . the 'kit ' did include bolts , washers , nuts , and an allen wrench for assembly though so i would email or call the manufacturer and have them send them to you . i 've ordered from lexmod before and was always happy with their products and service . 
yes 
the space for the holders is 3x3 . hope that helps . pam 
i think the dimension of the product are those shown on the website ... 10.8 x 5.1 x 8.6 inches 
yes , it does have an instruction manual with easy to follow recipes . i made a batch up yesterday following their basic instructions and it turned out really thick and tasty ! one thing i noticed in the recipe is that it called for 5 cups of milk along with the starter . since it has a one quart capacity i was confused by that so i used only 4 cups of milk , a half cup yogurt , and followed their tip for thicker yogurt by adding 1 2 cup of powdered milk and it came out perfect . for some more good recipes i went to www.eurocuisine.net and clicked on their manual for the ym80 yogurt maker and found a whole bunch of good info and recipes , you might check out those recipes too but buy the dash go , it 's the best and you do n't have to fool with all those little jars : o ) ! ! ! 
yes , you can make soy yogurt however , since soy is a very thin milk , you 'll have to add some thickening agents to get the yogurt to the right consistency . we recommend arrowroot or agar agar powder . 
100 % bpa free 
hello , our yogurt make maintains a temperature of about 110-120 degrees . kefir will do better in a temperture range of 70-80 degrees . 
hi michael , yes , you do have to heat the milk ( not boil ) before placing it into the unit for cooking . we suggest heating it with a double boiler method until it reached 185 degrees , and then letting it cool to about 100-110 degrees . this will kill all the excess bacteria that might interfere with the cooking process but keeps all the good ones that we need to create more yogurt ! 
yes and no ... . greek yogurt is pretty much any yogurt that has been strained to remove excess whey making it thick like sour cream consistency . the yogurt culture used and length of time it is cultured determines how tart it becomes . i allow my yogurt to ferment for 12 hours or more and use a greek yogurt strainer basket to remove the whey , it then taste very much like sour cream ( i used it as a substitute for any where i would use sour cream ; making mash potatoes , on top of tacos or baked potatoes ... ) . or i ferment it for about 8 hours without straining the whey and it is less tart and taste more like sweet yogurt . the yogurt culture used also makes a difference in taste , and the longer it ferments the more tart or sour it taste . the yogurt bacteria produces acids and the more acids produced the more tart it is . the tartness can be controlled by picking a yogurt culture and fermentation time that suits your taste . 
yes 
the built in timer allows you to preset the unit to turn on and off in half hour increments . 
yes , it does . 110 , 120 , 115 , are all interchangeable . 
normal or alittle more quiet 
it is only the ac . i did not buy the sleeve and i installed it directly to the hole in the wall and it is working fine 
just the back 
had item , and the timer still worked after 30 , plus years . however , the padded buttons started losing easy-to-connect setting feature . the timer itself , could have worked another 30 years . but , sent it out with the trash last month , after replacement was received and broke-in . i can still see it with my eyes closed . the base is about 3.5-inches square with viewing-slant running from about 1.75-inches in the back to 0.75-inches in the front . amazon product info shows weight at 2.4-ounces . i 'd say that is correct , with the one-aa battery . 
i would suggest the importer of the pot itself . 
i do n't know for sure but i did look at my older bodem press & its filter looks to be the same size . i would check bed bath & beyond , sur le tabla , or william sonoma ? i 've only had mine about 2 months now so have n't needed to replace mine yet . let me know if any of these work . thanks rick 
it appears to be a millimeter of two larger in diameter than my bodum french press . i had the same thought , to maybe just use the parts from my old press , but unfortunately they are just slightly smaller and do n't work . 
yes , and it keeps it warm for quite a while too . 
yes . its totally stainless & there are no plastic parts . i have been enjoying mine ! 
they seem to be the diameter of the average size bun . i would say 4 to 4.25 in . i have been using 5 to 5.5 oz of meat to make a patty , which creates a good balance between meat , bun and condiments . the dimple feature results in nice flat cooked patties . almost exclusively i cook these on an outdoor grill . 
a light spritz of cooking spray every couple of bugers works for me 
not necessary . as long as you use the plastic insert , the formed patty peels off easily . 
i do n't think so . the indentation in the center is for the burger to cook evenly . i prefer my burger press from tupperware . the burgers get stuck in this press . i even tried a suggestion from another customer and spray the press with cooking spray . still have to shake the burger out of the press . 
4.5 inches . great product lightly oil the inside of the press to make removal of the burger from the press easy 
www.highseer.com is where all the information is available . please click on information library button . 
takes between 3 to 6 hours to install . hourly rate changes from place to place . 
couple of cinder blocks is what i used . just put gravel under and call it done 
minimum amps is 16 and maximum is 25. or so it says on the condenser . 
it comes with everything you need for standard installation . 
yes it will fit . 
chair height total - 43 in width - 16 in seat height - 16 in 
i am not sure but maybe between 20-25 pounds 
approx . 17.5 inches from floor to seat , 43.5 inches from floor to very top of the back of the chair . 
they came 4 in a box , so i guess you would have to contact the company . they are great chairs tho ... 
i feel that they are not all that sturdy im 145lbs my husband is 200lbs it hold him but he also feels like it isnt sturdy . 
about 43-3 4 '' . 
the color is definitely whites and not off-white . i will be honest , these chairs although they are sturdy , have quite a bit of bounce in them when you sit on them and making them feel cheap and unsturdy . i would not recommend them . 
yes you can 
ive never bought the hydro flask , but in looking at it , i would have to say that this product is way bigger in that it olds 64 oz . instead of the 40 ... also it is double walled and stainless both in and out , we are very very happy with it and highly recommend : ) ) ) ) ) 
i would n't think so . the paint would probably knock right off . still worth the price and less expensive ( for now ) while everyone else buys the `` other guys '' brand . an independent salesman at a popular big box retail store told me they are in fact made in the same plant as the `` other guys '' brand . 
not sure there really is one . i have had mine for a few months now . i bought the 40 and 64 oz . i will be honest the finish could be a little tougher , but its ability to keep drinks cold or hot for an extended period of time is great . well worth the money . i will buy them again when i need to . 
it 's started to on the bottom . 
i know most of the wide mouth tops will fit it . i 've got a humangear on mine . 
from my understanding the husband and wife duo who started hydroflask got divorced and one of them launched this product , if you look up the materials it is exactly the same 
i 've always found gas to be better ( more controllable and hotter ) , but i 'm using mine with a 30 year old jenn-air and it cooks wonderfully ! 
`` oven safe up to 500 degrees f. do not use under broiler '' 
the one i have is 3-ply but i believe they have now come out with 5-ply . i have a 3 ply 10 '' without a cover and a 12 '' with a cover and i love them both ! 
not sure . check their website 
this pot is made in china . most of all clad is made in the us , but this is one of the few exceptions . 
yes 
probably the closest in size is a 6 qt . stockpot . there are sauce pans that are made in the usa for which you can buy inserts . the issue is all-clad inserts are made in china .

yes 
stockpot measures 9-5 8 inches in diameter . insert measures 9-1 2 inches in diameter . pot capacity is 6 quarts ; insert capacity is 4 quarts 
it works very well for steaming vegetables 
hey james , it 's not a sink into it and forget reality exists kind of couch but it 's certainly comfortable . when i snore too much my girlfriend sleeps out on it and she has no problem . when i have trouble sleeping in bed myself i go out to the couch and fall right to sleep . for the price i could n't ask for anything more . i 've also had no issues with the durability . hope that helps ! 
massive ! ! ! the delivery was transported to my home address and left outside on the driveway . two packages , one with the ottoman and the other with both sides of the sectional . all pillows and cushions are located inside the interior of the couch ( hidden panel under the slouch itself ) 
no . they can not be turned over . the seat cushions are very sturdy and do not show stains . the back cushions get kinda squished after a while but i could probably improve that if i tried . 
it 's very firm , but not so much that it is uncomfortable . i 'm very happy with it . 
thanks for your question , the total length of the sofa with chaise would be 112 '' ( i.e : 78 '' l sofa + 34 '' w chaise ) chaise : 84 '' x 34 '' x 35 '' h sofa : 78 '' x 34 '' x 35 '' h i hope this helps ! 
it is a dark gray 
it was delivered in three pieces . two very large and one large . all three pieces where damaged and you could see the drag marks the one truck driver sent to deliver all the way from the top of drive way around house and down the stairs . i contacted the shipping service provided them pictures and the gave me no help whatsoever . i will never buy anything from amazon again because of this horrible incident . 
thanks for your question ! this listing is for the vanilla color . we also have the deep red available on the site . you can view the listing here : www.amazon.com dp b00awdyujm i hope this helps ! 
mine is a queen size with dual controls . each side has it 's own settings and i love the preheat feature . when you turn it on it goes to your last set number but just push the button a second time for preheat . 
i have never gotten an f. i do get a p which means preheat . 
yes 
hello , thanks for your question . according to the information available for this heated blanket on a supplier 's website , this blanket is machine washable . have a great day ! 
it is not real leather , but it is a really good quality vinyl . i am very happy with this product and the price was reasonable . 
product dimensions : 24 x 24 x 17.8 inches ; 25 pounds 
it is 24 '' square and 17 '' tall . 
it is more of an espresso brown . 
4x4 
13 '' h x 19 '' x 19 '' 
to tell you the truth , i never finished it . i use it in the office . it runs for about 8hrs or less then i take it apart when i leave . i think it depends on how big of a water bottle you use . it has n't broken down on me yet . so it 's been good so far . 
about 3 ft ? ? 
10-12days from china . 
no , i hardly notice it running and it 's totally worth the investment . thinking about ordering another one for my nightstand ! 
i do n't know.. i think it would.. sometimes i have problems with water with high dissolved solids in the water.. distilled waterworks the best.. but some do say they do work with oils.. 
it is 7 3 4 '' tall . the opening is 1 3 4 '' tapering at the bottom . it holds approx 4 oz of liquid . they work great . 
i just put water in it , put the cap on , and shook it . it does n't leak . unless you squeeze it , then it will leak . 
i also threw out the box just last week ... i know the company was based out of the us , but i do n't remember if the box said anything else about where they were manufactured . if you can zoom in on the picture of the box on amazon , i think it has a website . maybe the information is there ? 
yes . 
7.6 inch x 5.5 inch x 0.5 inch 
it uses lithium cr2032 3v battery . it is small , light and lasts for a long time . one battery is included so you do n't have to buy the battery for a while . just remember to take the plastic piece behind the battery to active it . you can get 5 batteries for less than $ 3 on amazon with free shipping or 2 batteries for around $ 2.2 with free shipping ( no minimum purchase required for either option . ) thank you ! 
press button on back of scale 
i 'm not sure but the molds are silicone so they should be ok 
my kit arrived without any edible ingredients so the appliance is soy and gluten-free . you have to supply flavored and unflavored gelatin . 
designed in california 
i do n't see why not . though i do n't know how well agar sets up , and do n't know if it changes the taste any , as compared to gelatin . try getting information from the company directly . i just looked in the booklet that came with the unit , and there were no vegan gummy worm ... recipes , but , i know there are some online . hope this helps a little . jami 
yes it does . you can actually forgo using the electric pot and use a small pan on top of the stove instead . 
you can fill all 4 silicon trays at once . there are 7 worms , 9 fish and 11 bears in each tray . 
heating , pouring , jelling took about an hour as i recall . could heat and fill molds and then eat cake before unmolding . might need a few rounds to let each kid have a turn . this could be accomplished using microwave extra molds . 
it does n't say on the box but i bought it for my 9 year old daughter for christmas . 
yes , there is a removable filter to take out and clean . the filter would remove from the right hand side of the front panel of the unit . 
i purchased model acq088gpx - 8000 btu whirlpool a c unit and it came with a use & care guide # 1545059- it is made in china by hisense and their c.s . number is 1-877-465-3566 -- -- a. cramer

thanks for your question . our peelers are indeed dishwasher safe and can be run in a normal cycle , but most of our customers do n't really even need to send it through a full cycle . most are doing a fine job cleaning it by simply using warm water and a soft brush . one thing you should not do is use a hard , abrasive brush or cleaner such as steel wool because that would ruin the finish . additionally , if you have well water or hard water , it is suggested to wash by hand and dry fully . hardwater contains excess iron which may cause rust on stainless steel objects when left wet and exposed to air . 
thank you for your question . our customers and we at uberchef have julienned zuchinni , carrots , potatoes , sweet potatoes , butternut squash , celery , cucumber , applies , kiwi , and a whole lot more : ) test out our julienne peeler and let us know what your results are and what fruits veggies you 've used it on ! 
thanks for your question . the usable portion of the julienne side is just a hair over 1.75 inches in width . the regular serrated side is 1.875 inches in width . and the overall width of the head is about 3.44 inches . hope this helps ! 
more like angel-hair than spaghetti 
thanks for your question . you should be able to use the julienne blade ( or the regular peeler blade for that matter ) on cheddar without issue . our peeler works best on medium and hard cheeses , as compared to softer cheeses such as fresh mozzarella , for example . i hope this helps ! 
hi barney , thanks for your question . though our peeler can tackle many projects , a pineapple is probably not a good one to try . the skin on a pineapple is likely far too thick for either of the blades to cut through . 
absolutely ! try making a nice mango slaw with it . a new way to enjoy one of my favorite fruits : ) best , ellyn co-founder 
i 've personally never tried it on a green plantain , however , i have tried it on an orange , green bell pepper , an unripe banana and of course the typical fruits and veggies you 'd peel with a peeler . this is the real deal . i love it ! 
i believe this one is also nylon . but it is super soft ! 
do n't know the exact dimensions but pretty big . like movie poster size 
it 's 22x34 
it came rolled up in a box , but not shrink wrapped 
i have mine on a flex steel recliner . the two grasps on the bottom of the couch tray expand to 9.5 inches . i hope that helps . 
drawing in this poster is a view from rockefeller center i guess . glass front also a drawing . 
that the artwork is mounted to foamboard or other rigid medium like cardstock 
definitely ... ..we do not have any headboards in the house . over this bed and frame we have a wall hanging - no headboard , no problem ! 
clearance is about 6.5 '' . 
i 've had this bed frame for a while now & there 's no squeaking or shaking , it 's very sturdy & secure . hope this helps . 
the feet are square so it depends on how the gliders attach to them . 
no . it comes with all parts needed and is easy to assemble . i bought two queens over two months ago and love them ! very sturdy with no slats needed . 
no ... and the assembly instructions are pitiful . however , once assembled , it works and looks great . 
yes . 
each compartment had two shelves . top shelf is 10 1 2 in tall x 81 2in d x 8 in w. bottom shelf is 10 3 4 in tall 81 2d x 8 in w. compartment sizes are identical . hope this helps . 
only white from what i saw . would be easy to paint though if necessary , probably take less then 30 minutes . 
my husband loves it , great for wood stoves , or inserts in your fireplace , fill it water , helps humiity in air . 
hi bob , the deminsions are 7-3 4 '' l x 5-1 2 '' w x 9 '' h. this steamer holds 1 quart of water . - crystal , plow & hearth customer service 
yes the neato requires two batteries . 
the neato robotics website shows one size battery for all of their models . i have not had any problems with crucial vacuum batteries . i am very satisfied with them . 
yes , it can work with the xv-21 . i 'd bought for spare to the xv-21 . 
just got mine and they 're the same rating as the originals : 3200mah . 
it 's on amazon . 18 10 gorham is an excellent brand . i worked in their market research dept and am aware of what is meant by `` weight . '' it has nothing to do with how much the flatware weighs ; it is the percentage of certain elements used in the manufacture of the stainless . 18 10 is a better weight . 
yes , they are the traditionally shaped sort that feel right in the mouth and hand . they are especially heavy and bright -- after a year or so of use and dishwasher washing . 
yes , have washed them in the dishwasher with no problems . 
no , it was made in china . 
it does ! it has a little book with 30 recipes i believe . 
yes 
yes , you can use real fruit too 
i am just researching to choose which to buy , so i have n't used it , but i came across a consumer report on the nutribullet and they said the new model had blades crack and break off when crushing ice . this is a huge safety concern , as you drink directly from the container and would never see a small piece of blade until you drink it . they did say the old models did n't have that problem . they recommended the nutri ninja instead , for safety and reliability . 
after using it for a couple of days , my thoughts have changed . yes it 's noisy , but it 's not on that long ( 10-20 seconds max ) . when i first used the nutri ninja pro , it was ~ midnight or 2am in the morning so it was definitely noisy when all was quiet and there was no ambient noise . when i used it the following day , around lunch time , it did n't seem as noisy , when there were other ambient noises in house and outside . so for those concern about noise . i would suggest getting it , trying it , if you do n't like it return it . after all noise is subjective . i would n't want anyone to miss out because of my experience ... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ original review after using in only one time in wee hours of the morning ... yes , it 's very powerful ; however , i found it to be very noisy in comparison to the basic nutribullet ; however , the basic nutribullet is n't as powerful either . perhaps it needs to be broken in first . i just purchased mine yesterday evening and family said they hope i do n't use it in morning while when they are sleeping ... it 's noisy enough that i may return mine . i 've owned magic bullet , nurtribullet ( 2 ) , vitamix 5200 & 6300 and this seems louder for the basic blending it 's doing .

yes it will . my husband keeps liquor in a cabinet so it 's room temp as well . by the time he drinks it it is cold . 
they are steel with a liguid core 
the writer made a mistake it 's a stocking stuffer like you hang on christmas .

they are made in china , just like all the others ones on here . 
plate and stand pillar dimensions are as follows : - ( 2 ) 6 inches plates ( 4 ) 8 inches plates ( 4 ) 10 '' plates ( 4 ) 12 '' plates ( 1 ) 14 '' plate ( 2 ) 5 inch stands pillars ( 2 ) 10 `` stands pillars ( 2 ) 15 '' stands pillars ( 1 ) 20 inch stands pillar 
yep , everything comes in parts , meaning the tiers and pillars can be arranged any way you want.. i only use a couple at a time actually.. 
they are all different sizes with no edge to the stand so you can out whatever shape you want on the stand 
no , the order just comes with the stands . 
not at all..when we finished using them i even washed them..they are reusable 
i do n't make cup cakes just cakes but if i had to take a guess , 80-100 cup cakes 
yes 
yes both pillows 
yes simple . to assemble no tools . needed 
checked the sofa when i got home . nope can not be flipped bottom portion of the sofa seat is different fabric . someone with sewing skill could probably create new seat covers for it ... neither the seat nor the back is attached to the sofa . 
yes . 
no 
height 2 '' each and diameter 6.25 inches . 
the diameter is six inches . 
the packaging does not state if they are bpa free , may need to check with the manufacture . 
eight inches high . 
on mine there is no number inside the triangle . 
i do n't know , but they are pretty sturdy . 
pop the clamp up and unlocks . entire lid folds back while still attached at the back of canister . 
my husband undid the clasp and used the clasp to pry the top open . 
no . it is not designed for freezing . also the metal locking parts may become very brittle . try a softer plastic designed for freezing . 
did you try `` kitchen gaskets '' at amazon ? i think that they have them . if not , usd google to find the oggi url . 
yes , it sure will . 
bottom cushions are about 6.5 '' and back cushions are about 8 '' 
seat height is approx . 19 in . 
the seat is 20 '' height and 20 '' deep . 
removable yes . reversible no 
i did n't have a 64 box of crayons as a kid so describing the color is difficult for me : d the coloron my laptop monitor does match the real life sofa . it 's not really beige ... but a neutral color ... 
plywood and hardwood frame . the hardwoods are `` lighter '' species - looks like poplar or similar . 
yes , but no heat ! if they shrink even a tiny bit , it would be impossible to get them back over the cushions . 
its louder than a regular blender , which in all honesty i think its expected considering the amount of blending power it outputs . 
it is not recommended . the jars though are easy to wash , use the pulse mode with hot water and soap after rinsing . rinse and let it dry while standing . 
it works great for apples and everything else i have put in there . i have never tried coconut , but that 's a good idea . i will have to try it ! 
yes , easily . instructions are included in the recipe book that comes with the blender . 
who is the low ? 
maybe , i have a regular xbox on mine and a dvd player . 
i had to return my ematic . emd213 3 unit , as the support bracket packaged with the unit was way too small and the screw holes too far apart to secure to a single stud . so therefore , answer is no , as the unit cannotsupport itself . 
about 18 '' or 19 '' 
no i have nt & # 128522 ; . i pull the plug it will keep the coffee warm for a while 
i think black and decker made the pot i would try them 
i bought this for my father as a christmas present . and the auto turn off would turn on and off at random . a month later it went in the trash . i would not recommend this item . it is cheaply made in china . 
not to my knowledge . the inside and lid are all ( or at least seem to be ) stainless steel . 
most likely the `` auto-off '' feature is a function of the 'boil dry ' safety feature : pot gets hot ! as it becomes empty and thus automatically switches 'off ' : witch is coupled with the automatic `` keep warm '' { not hot } when the pot is still partially full ( ~1 6 ) , and is not empty and getting hot . ~ rhf 
i had to buy another percolator after six months , because this one did not keep the coffee as hot as it once did ... .. 
it actually looks exactly like the picture . my daughter loves it . the colors are rich . 
i purchased this reversible comfortable as a gift but the material did n't feel slippery , i think it would stay put . 
they are reversible in full size . 
no , you need clean it , but you do that when you take the blue water container off to fill and clean the top of the stand and where you fill the water . we use filtered water so only have to clean every couple of weeks , but the booklet says every week . hope this helps . 
the instructions do not say you have to use distilled water , relying on their filter to keep out mineral build up , but clearly using distilled water would work better and you do not have to replace the filter at some point . 
the attached series of videos will help you for all aspects of caring for your humidifier . http : edu.burgayocoffee.com search.php ? id=vicks+v4600+humidifier 
this model does not use filters 
no 
yes , unless you have a very large hand , i do exactly that from time to time . however if you use distilled water as we do , it seldom needs to be wiped out . we are very pleased with our unit , we use it most of the time and find it to be effective and inexpensive to use . i definitely recommend this product ... all pro 's and no con 's 
there are a lot of corners to clean . i was surprised just how quickly it starts to get moldy so you really need to keep on top of it . 
they do include one or two aroma packets although you do n't have to use them . 
a bit less than 1 ounce , because a full ounce is too much ! 
they vary slight because of shapes but average about 1 3 4 '' in diameter 
yes , ship from china 
yes 
i have no idea , ,mine was stolen outside my door before i ever got it , , 
yes it is 
almost all of the time ceramic glassware is lead free . the glassware you should watch out for is crystal-ware since the crystallization is created using a lead compound . this is especially true when the crystal is tinted . tinted glass is okay , but tinted crystal-ware is usually not . regardless , the problem is caused when you are using acidic foods and beverages within these containers since they can cause lead leakage . as long as you are using a fairly neutral ph in tinted crystal-ware you should still be fine . 
i was very pleasantly surprised that they do not ! ! ! i love my set ! ! 
definitely red . 
i 'm not sure exactly but the bowls are huge ! 
i would n't say `` easily '' but i do have one that is chipped . it 's not impossible . 
i have n't been able to find them . - wanted some pasta bowls and ordered tequila and they matched pretty well . just a thought 
it is orange 
yes 
well , yes and no.as far as i know , the federal law pertaining to stills are fairly rigid and enforced . this still , however , does fall within the guidelines set out : 1 ) you can own a still as long as the capacity is 1 gallon or less . while this still advertises a 1 and 1 2 gallon capacity , it 's usable capacity is certainly not more than a gallon . 2 ) you can not make alchohol with it ( without a special license and that alchohol produced is only for racing cars , not human consumption ) . you can however make perfumes and spice extracts ( like i do ) with a still of this size and be perfectly within the law . so , no . owning a small still it is perfectly legal ; using it to make actual moonshine on the other hand is verboten . you `` probably '' wo n't get investigated for it . 
sure , sugar cane and black strap molasses 
not very much ... ! you can find out the difference on a bunch of pages on it out there on the web ... 
it is small , only 1 1 2 gallons . will fit on standard stove ( under range hood ) 
in response to your question about recipie with cook times , the only way i 've found is through you tube or find a local store that sells wine and liquor making kits as a hobby . i wish you a good batch ! - greg 
does not say ... .the only markings are the `` cup & fork '' symbol that means it 's safe for contact with food . they were packaged 2 different `` shapes '' together in a clear plastic bag that had no markings . mine were shipped from china . 
if you put jello on one side , you will get the shape , like an ice cube holder . if you want the 3d effect , then you can set one side first , then the next and hope that they stick together when you clip the already settled side to the liquid side that 's about to settle ( keeping the second side down , of course ; these are not leak-proof ! ) but the best way would be to keep them open and use them like ice cube holders to get two jello shapes from one mold ... 
yes . but need to do while still hot and use larger eggs and skim excess off with paring knife . 
for usa residents is 2-5 days . 
rinse with mild soap and warm water and let it air dry with end caps off . 
it 's about 8-9 inches talk and about and almost two inches in diameter . we 've had it for a while now and it 's a great product , well made , very user friendly and very easy to adjust from course to fine . hope this helps ! 
absolutely ! ! as far as it goes that i can tell , this mechanical devise has been so nice for me that is , that you could use it for a number of different herbs or different salts , peppercorns , etc ... i have a variety in mine presently . and on the opposite end have a part himalayan salt part hawaiian black salt combo ! ! it is definitely your preference as long as you stick to the guidelines on not over tightening for the size of how fine you want it to grind . which i have had no problem with mind the way it came ... 
it doesnt , many of our customer prefer different types of salt and pepper so we let them fill it with their preference on their own . 
target stores 
the only way home brewing would be an option is if you were able to reuse an old barrel . i doubt stores sell an empty barrel . 
no but it is still awesome ! 
yes it does . my only issue with the system is finding the refills . they are not sold in most areas as of now . i had to call many local budweiser distributors until i found someone that would go through the trouble of locating and getting me the refills . good luck ! 
i only wast able to use once so i do n't not where to buy another but i will sell you my 
each refill is a 1 gallon refill ; which is about the equivalent of 10.5 cans of beer . this produces great tasting beer ; and since you can pour exactly the amount you want , i believe it is worth it ! 
no . this is basically a big can . once the can is open thats it . in other words , can you refill a `` normal '' beer can ? ... ... ... ... no you ca n't . too bad though . 
the wolfgang puck infomerical stated that the oven would cook frozen foods ; adjust time and temperature for that . 
on my oven ( non-rotisserie ) the handle on the valve goes to the v. the valve handle points to you if you are in front of the oven . 
yep , junk , very dissatisfied . but if you want to take a chance on it , buy it here through amazon . that way you at least have a chance to return it and get your money back . the company that supports these is notorious for weak support . 
yes , it is flexible enough to fit from about an inch to and inch and a half or a little more . that part that angles in will spread out . 
it has give , , , i would say yes ... we love ours we have two ... in the bathroom 
we have ours under a shelf , and it works fine . i think it reacts to movement , rather than something in proximity . we like ours very much . 
10 '' wide-7.7 '' deep-14.5 '' high you can find conversion charts at conversionchart.org and click on length . 
standard tub shower size ... 
i do n't know the specific length but it is long in the tub . i have an old tub and know nothing about new tubs but there is no way it would slip out and wet the floor . it is great : dries quickly w o any streaking . it does cling to the tub but you can carefully pull it away with no trouble . 
yes , it is 
no . but idk why that would n't work . : - ) 
i do n't really think there 's a way to do that . but it is a very nice cabinet . 
just about 22 '' l x 10 '' w 
2 doors that swing open out from the center go from top to bottom . easy access to entire cabinet . 
it 's 64 inches high 
24 '' wide , 15 '' deep 
i asked tuft and needle about the `` foldability '' of their mattresses before purchasing and they said that while they do not fold in three like traditional shikibuton , they can fold in half . this was their response : `` the tuft & needle five mattress can be folded in half , from head to foot , but , it needs some help to stay there . due to the resilient nature of the mattress , it would `` pop open , '' without something to hold it down , though a couple heavy books will do the trick . i 'll link a photo and video demonstrating : https : www.dropbox.com sh xrjc8bax8tdagf0 aabenjgl2pfieunkrr1fieeza # lh : null-_mg_6570.jpg https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=ssw1fwgirhm & feature=youtu.be '' if you have n't bought your mattress yet and would like $ 50 off , you can use this link : https : www.tuftandneedle.com r bhpgcl3p it will also get me $ 50 off of my recent order , so we would both win : ) 
according to t & n 's website specs page , the full mattress measurements are 54 '' x 75 '' x 5 '' and it weighs approximately 33 lbs . https : www.tuftandneedle.com bed specs 
i got a set of fitted sheets from target that said they were for mattresses up to 8 '' high . there is quite a bit of material that is under the mattress , but the top is smooth and i no longer have the fitted sheet coming off the mattress like i did with my old bed . 
is more firm then memory foam . better support . i use it for last few months and we love it it . 
yup we use it directly on the floor and it 's super comfy . 
yes , it can be rolled up and put in a fiddle bag . depending on your bed size , it might take a large duffle . after unrolling , it should n't take long to expand back to size . 
i guess the best answer i can give for this is that regular memory foam feels `` dryer '' or `` crisper '' to me . it 's still squishy , but you do n't sink into the bed as much and it has a little bit more resistance . this gel infused one feels more dense and that makes it more squishy for some reason . i like it much better than the regular memory foam . 
i have a mattress pad on top of it & it does n't get hot at all . in fact , thats one of the things i love about it ! 
yes , but we recommend only using it on the lowest setting . 
hell yeah it will ! i love the sleep master : ) 
this is very comfortable to sleep on and it 's not hot . 
i found my bed more comfortable with this on , and my bed was already soft to begin with . soft and comfort are both subjective though , so i ca n't guarantee you 'll have the same experience . 
these are 18 10 goods 
yes the knives have a serration . 
the dinner fork is 8 '' long 
sturdy and not too heavy . i mainly use the salad fork for my meals because its easier to hold , in my opinion . the set is very nice though . 
hi oscar -- thanks for your inquiry . you can use any liquid you choose in the soda plus . it 's fun to fizz up your favorite fruit juices and try different juice combinations -- and it 's more economical . you can even make sparkling wines and re-carbonate beverages that have gone flat . also , the soda plus is easy to use and uses any standard brand of co2 cartridge so you 're not limited by more expensive proprietary brands . we hope this information has been helpful . if you want to learn more , please feel free to contact us . best regards , aaa kitchenstuff 
while it has the exact same cap and works the same way , the bottle is larger ( 1.2 l vs .75 l ) and made better . i had two mastrad 's before buying this one and both developed a leak within the first week of use and had to be returned . 
no . it uses standard 8 gm seltzer cartridges . search amazon for `` seltzer charger . '' i have found that the leland chargers available here on amazon are the best value . 
i have some reservations . it does n't make the drinks fizzy enough . i think i should have bought something like a soda stream . 
yes very tight fit.will fit multiple.hope you enjoy them . 
the long answer : the paint has chipped already . i use dobie sponges . idk if that 's what 's causing it . or if it 's just an indication of the quality of the pots and pans . but for $ 60 bucks i ca n't complain . the short answer : i have n't tried it and i would n't recommend it . 
no magnets do not stick to aluminum . the bottom is aluminum . we absolutely love these pans ! 
wood or plastic utensils 
tried to upload a picture here of 1 of my lime green pots 
unfortunately in china 
18.5 '' 
standard plastic air lock -- chicago brew werks 
yes , with a rubber grommet . 
it 's made in china . the quality is okay though . it keeps beverages hot cold for a while as it 's double-walled . 
no it does n't . unless you freeze the mug 
3 1 4 `` across top x 5 '' tall 
no , it 's an open mug . 
other sites advertise that it will keep hot beverages toasty without making the handle hot . 
it does n't get unusually hot..no more so than most stoneware . 
yes 
yes they are ! 
no 
hi wendy ! top=12x13 bottom=9.5x11 8 '' tall `` scoop '' =8.5x3.5 
to store them , yes . 
hello , thank you for your question . according to the manufacturer the dimensions are 13 x 12 x 8 inches . this information can also be found on the product detail page under the `` product description '' section . i hope this helps ! 
yes , it can . i have very thick carpeting in my living room and neato works like a charm on it ! 
i 've got 2 of these . one for the 1st floor and one for the 2nd ( yeah , i know - i 'm too lazy to carry the thing up and down the stairs ) . i have hardwood floors throughout and 9 different area throw rugs scattered about . have n't had any significant issues . though if the rug has long tassels , i could see them potentially getting tangled in the brush . another potential issue is if the rug is unusually deep ( like a heavy shag ) , it might have some trouble making the transition from floor to rug . 
90 days 
90 days refurbished . new ones are one year . 
try to upgrade firmware with pc ? 
they appear to be brand new batteries . and the vac works great . i am a lazy bachelor , the carpet and tile is the only thing clean in my house , and thats because of the robot . now if i could figure out a way to get it to do the dishes . 
works great just as it does on hardwood floors . however , i do n't use it on terra cotta ( mexican ) tile floors because they are uneven , and i 'm concerned that the vibration will eventually damage the machine . just like all other floor areas , you may want to thoroughly vacuum occasionally to clean edges and corners or sweep them out prior to running the neato . after years of roombas , love , love , love neato ! 
20 '' when the back cushions are in place 
got mine a while ago..from what i remember it was about 3 ' x 3 ' x 3 ' . not huge..i was impressed by their packing mastery . 
it is stable . seating pillows do not keep you stable . - too much air and not flat . 
if i recall they were odorless . not sure if they were toxic . 
the tray is 11.5 inches deep with a lip on front and back edges . it is 15 inches wide but there is no lip on the sides so a lap top can be wider than 15 inches . i am using the cart to hold a medical laser and it is very hi-tech looking and suits my need perfectly 
this comforter is dry clean only . yet few customer have washed them in the past and then tossed them in dryer with tennis balls and worked out well . its not guaranteed though . 
yes it is . very nice . 
yes i 'm afraid so . 
we have had ours a few months now . we keep it inside a flannel duvet and have not had any issues with shedding . hope this helps . 
i do n't know . 
i take it to the dry cleaners ... it is too big to fit in my washing machine . 
no , it 's not . 
yes . just like all of the dysons it pulls out of the handle . 
great question ! i have plush carpets in my home including a rug with almost 2 inch pile . it works wonderfully on my thick carpet . it has no problem gliding across it and pulling up all the dirt and hair . i was most impressed by the fact that it worked awesome on my rug . because the rug is so thick , there 's going to be some resistance , but it is the first vacuum that could handle moving across the rug without the beaters getting tangled in a pile . when comparing my other vacuums it seems that the bristles on the beater are shorter which is why it works so well in carpets like this . definitely worth it . 
the models are basically the same . the only difference is you get more `` extension '' tools with the animal . 
i have 3 cats and a dog ... the dc65 multi floor picks up pet hair fabulously ! ... amazing..i also use a hair remover brush thingy ( lol ) for blankets and furniture ... $ 5 compared to the pet attachment.. 
glass ... small juice glasses 
painted stained . hand wash. i love mine ! 
44 in . wide , 30 1 4-in . high , 20 in . deep 
it 's not high quality materials - it 's particle board basically . the top is finished exactly like the rest of it . 
you can leave it out . 
the top is mdf laminated with a heavy papery wood looking finish . it is pretty durable . the sides are multiple materials . the corner pieces appear to be wood . the x side support is also either wood or mdf . the backing behind the x piece is really a heavy cardboard type material laminated like the top . my unit does n't get heavy use so it works well . it looks very nice for the price . it would not do well with heavy use because the ding and dent factor would be prohibitive . 
there are 2 shelves ; they are approximately 19 '' long and 16 '' wide . keep in mind that the manufacturer places a 'sticker ' of some kind right on the top and when you take it off it takes off the finish . nice , huh ? 
it 's dark brown 
china . it 's stamped on the handle . 
yes it would . for that matter any knife or sharp cutting device would scratch a non stick pan . i normally transfer my pizza onto a cutting board before i slice it . 
solid stainless steel metal 
height is 50 inches . width is 63 inches . 
yes , if you have a frame . 
i would say yes but not 100 % sure . the top half of the headboard is separate from the legs when it arrives . i have a platform bed with a ridge on all four sides and i just propped the top half on the ridge and scooted the mattress up against it . it stays just fine . and it 's not too heavy so as long as the mattress is against it , it 's sturdy . looks great , too ! ! ! 
i 'm not at home right now but i believe so ... .but it changes the entire look of the room . 
21 inches from the floor to the bottom part of the upholstered headboard . i use mine with a regular metal frame and box spring . there is no gap from the top of the bed and the headboard if that 's what you were asking . 
from floor to the top surface of the bed is 11 '' . 
hello lisa , thank you for your interest in this south shore step one platform bed . yes , for sure ! you can find the instructions on our website , www.southshorefurniture.com . if you are having trouble finding them on our site , you can always call our customer service , it will be our pleasure to send you them by email . for additional information , feel free to contact our customer service at 1-800-290-0465 or visit our website at www.southshore.ca : ) 
yes , there is one part that completely stays inside the wood , all pieces are labled . just be careful , take your time , and keep the instructions above all . 
this does n't come with a mattress boxspring , the only thing you are ordering is the platform ( you should n't buy it if you do n't want the platform ! ) . sorry if i misunderstood you . 
it does not 
yes , it does swivel from side to side . 
it has to be attached at the bottom . 
estimate : 15x13 in . 
the chair is 36 '' high , 15 '' wide , and seat is 19 '' high . very comfortable . 
i believe that we bought the 2.5 l. that is enough for a family in one sitting . works well . 
there is no plastic in contact with water on the inside of the samovar . everything that is in contact is either tempered glass or stainless steel . i hope that helps ! 
these are `` about '' measurements , since the bag expands wider when you put clothes in . 10 '' wide , 14 '' deep , 20 '' tall in front and 24 '' in back . hope this helps 
yes , the wires just loop through the top of the bag for easy removal . 
canvas like material 
not firm , but fluffy 
i think they are medium firm and they do keep their shape 
two pillows 
hi marie , nope . the hole is n't big enough for an umbrella pole to go through . however , amazon does have outdoor table lazy susans . i found this one for you and there are others - royal tahiti 20 '' round lazy susan w umbrella hole ( stain ) ( 1.25h x 20w x 20d ) - some are glass and some are tiered . hope this helps . kathy 
no . it spins 360 degrees . i have a pair of huge peavy speakers on mine . when i 'm working , i point the speakers to my desk . when i 'm running on the treadmill , i point them at the treadmill . they 're great and handle a lot of weight . 
although this turntable says it is rated for 150lbs . i feel the quality just isnt there . it 's mostly plastic . i purchased to put a round three tier glass table on it . i have about 50lbs on it and it has a hard time turning smoothly . my advice is look for something else of better quality . hope this helps . 
hi restin . not knowing the statue you have , i ca n't guarantee it wo n't tip over ! however , the kind of base table that your statue and swivel are going to be on is important -- needs to be sturdy and level . i would place the object on the swivel with the front pulled a little forward and the heavy back being somewhat more to the center , if this is possible with your statue . the swivel base itself has been very sturdy for our use ( 60lb bonsai that i can now rotate easily and smoothly ) . play with it . also , `` museum gel , '' bought at art stores , is very helpful for peace of mind . i hope this is helpful -- lise 
it is not glass on the inside ... .. more like plastic . it did n't keep the coffee hot for very long since it is n't glass . 
the difference is in the remote . the ffre1233q1 includes a temperature sensing remote . this model does not include the temperature sensing feature . imho , the temperature sensing does n't work that well anyway , and is something of a gimmick , so buy this one and save $ 30 . but it 's your call ... 
1 year but u can buy a 2 yr warranty 
yes , it comes with a 2 piece window screen . it will work with windows up to 28 '' wide i believe . 
you can not use this unit for a side slide window , they make special units for side windows . they cost much much much more . 
all air conditioners create condensation . if you ca n't have the condensation spilling out the back outside on the ground , you will need a tube to divert the condensation to an acceptable location . 
no i have this in an older mobile home and it is just fine no support needed 
22 w by 24 w by 17 h 
we did not use a support mount and feel comfortable without one . 
the box says designed in france , i see nothing about china on the box . ( mine is still in the box ) but the fact that it says `` designed in france '' would lead me to believe that is was manufactured somewhere else . it is a nice set , heavy . 
yes , the box said 18 10.i gave this to my daughter for christmas . it was an impressive set.beautiful . 
yes ! and quite lovely so ! the bottom design is repeated on the flip side and the stripes coming down are halved on the back , meaning there are about half as many stripes on the back . it is balanced and the pieces feel good in the hand . 
not overly heavy . substantial and nicely balanced . classic bistro with flair . 
17 inches 
idk ... 
sorry - no idea . they seem very sturdy , but we have n't had anyone much over 200 lbs sit on them . hope this helps . 
you can see light through it . it 's semi opaque . 
very thin sheet of plastic . probably the thickness of about 5 sheets of paper . it is cut resistant . you can roll it up for storage . perfect for my needs . 
the cutting mat is a milky color but there is n't any problem seeing through it . if i were to print a screen copy of this internet page , i would n't have any problem reading the text through the mat ! the mat surface has a very mild texture and makes a good cutting surface . 
nope ! i had to look nsf up before i could answer . the cutting mat ( it 's not a board ) is free of any labelling whatsoever . 
no , it will slide . i have an espresso maker on it so it stays in place . it 's large so i do n't think it would slide real easy . 
yes the back of the unit is open and the condenser coils are exposed . every unit designed to mounted in a window is going to have the condenser exposed out of necessity . the condenser must have maximum air exposer for the unit to work efficiently . putting anything over the face of the coils would be the same as blocking of the grille for the radiator on your car while driving it . 
depending on what state you live in most now require a metal bracket or brackets to support the air conditioner from outside your window .you can get one at home depot or any good hardware store , you might even find it on amazon so no the unit does not come with brackets . 
yes . 
approximately six feet with a a gfi grounded plug 
yes . 
i have two frigidaire acs and have never had drainage problems . drainage has not been an issue on amazon reviews either . that does n't mean you do n't have a drainage problem . you might need someone with ac knowledge to take a good look at how the machine is working as well as the installation fitting . hope this helped . 
hi there.. i do n't believe so ... it should work on any 15amp circuit ... . i do n't see what the amp rating is on the a c but i would assume it 's about 7.5-8 ... . which is probably less than a toaster ... . 
no , but the surface was very easy to clean with a sponge and detergent by standing on non outlet end in the sink . i thought it was easier to clean than models that could be submersed . 
yes , you can use olive oil or butter when cooking on this griddle . 
no ... just a warming tray that slides underneath 
i can only tell you , i tried to set it on warm and sometime it would work . i melted the end of a spatula on warm . i returned it to the the mfr . and it was replaced with a same griddle with a black cooking surface that works fine . i am sure that the first one was defective and based on comments i have seen , it 's not the only one ! 
normal is just standard operations for the fan , nature is breeze ( fan goes slower and faster randomly ) , and sleep mode lets you set a timer so it turns off automatically . 
it is louder then i would have wanted it but it cools a room down and has a strong wind flow . so that overrides any noise issue i have . when watching tv and it is on low it is fine but if you put it up to high then you might want to put the volume up . it does not bother me when sleeping as it acts as white noise and is easy to sleep rest to . 
the timer goes from 1 to 12 hours . 
regular u.s. house current 110 120 not sure if it 's compatible with euro standards . i do n't think it draws that much juice . 
made in china . 
the inside is plastic . 
no straw included , although any straw would fit . and the lid is pressure fitted , it does not screw on . i spent 2 minutes to learn that . 
yes , perfectly ! 
thanks for asking . the outside length from the tip to the cuff is 11 5 8 '' long . there is no extended cuff . the mitt does normally extend at least 2.5 '' past the wrist , though , so it does offer protection for the wrist area . how big hand will it fit ? it will fit hands up to 2.5 '' thick ( measuring the thickness of the palm at the thumb ) and 4.75 '' wide ( measuring the width of the hand where the thumb connects to the rest of the hand ) . so , it will fit a fairly large hand . a hand that is 2.5 '' thick and 4.75 '' width will be snug in the mitts , but can still work comfortably . i hope all that helps . : ) let us know if you have any additional questions . 
you can not detach the liner , but it can be pulled inside out . my recommendation is , if you get bbque sauce in it or something , to do the following . reach inside and grab the very end of the liner between 2 fingers , while pushing in the mitt from the top so that the liner will be easier to grab . in one swift motion , pull the liner completely inside out . then pull the thumb area out from the rest of the liner . hang over the edge of the sink and wash the liner with whatever soap you want to . take care to not get water into the inside of the mitt itself , to speed drying . dish soap is actually fine because it will cut any grease better . rinse thoroughly under the faucet to remove the soap . then either lay on the counter to dry or hang on a clothes line . let it dry so you feel no dampness in the liner . then carefully stuff the liner back into the silicone shell . hope that helps ! - ken , nurturing planet awesome support 
the sound produced is barely noticeable from the motor including the impeller . sometimes the water circulation can make a little noise moving around the food items . 
no it wo n't , i do n't think has the power needed for this amount of water 
yes 
yes , the screen displays the set to temp and the temp of the water . 
a little bit , yes . it 's held up really well , actually , and that 's with everyday use with two kids and a cat on it , so i recommend it . 
the device has 2 options , 1 is 1080p , the other is 720p . so it is up to you to choose . 
yes - the enko enko mini composite hdmi to rca cvbs av converter ( input : hdmi ; output : av ) has a hdmi input to the av rca connections . the tv will have the older av connections output from the converter while the xbox has the hdmi input to the converter . 
the mini it self is a converter , the micro usb is used to power the converter . 
hi , thank you for contacting us however our product can be used in transmitting any thing that is already sending a video signal it does not have to video outs if you have any other questions please feel free to ask thank you . 
yes , the usb cable provided with enko product is a mini , but it is useful providing power to the device only . this device takes a hdmi standard cable signal and converts it to an rgb signal . 
the tag says only the case is . 
i 'm 5'2 '' and the pillow stops around mid shin for me . i want to say somewhere around 4 and a half feet . i bought a pillow case that was 21 inches wide 54 inches long and it fits it perfectly . 
should be fine may get some clumps like a normal pillow . stuffed to the brink though 
there is a very smooth internal seam . yes . 
hi ling yi , the jar itself is approximately 3 3 8 '' ( 8.57 cm ) in diameter with the bottom base at 3 5 8 '' ( 9.21 cm ) in diameter and it 's height is 6 '' ( 15.24 cm ) . hope this helps ! the chillwarmer team

the thermometer comes with a very handy and easy to read plastic card with all the meat and poultry temperatures on it . this handy little card is attached to the plastic sheath with a silver chain . the print is easy to read unlike thermometers that have the temperature printed on the sheath . if you did not receive a temperature chart please contact us and it will be mailed out to you at no charge . 
yes . the instructions call it `` self-calibration . '' it instructs to put the stem into one inch of ice water and then push the cal button for 2 seconds .

instant reads only . you do n't want to leave it in the oven or bbq while cooking . it is a great thermometer . 
for a beef medium well temperature of 165 degrees i have found that it is very accurate . i have compared to a analog thermometer and it was within 2 degrees each time . not bad for an instant read . hope this helps . 
check to see if the frame has holes in it at the ends as that 's how the headboard attaches to the frame . most mattresses fit on a metal frame that adjusts to size , and this headboard uses the predrilled holes in a metal frame to attach to with bolts . you could drill holes in a wooden frame of a futon to make it work , perhaps , but that 's much more work than putting this on a predrilled frame and depends on having the right spacing in the wood and sufficient strength of the wood for these holes . 
mattress + box spring . there was no problem with the height . 
height is 50 inches from bottom to top . we bought this for my daughter 's room and it 's very nice . 
i ca n't answer that i 'm afraid . i ordered it from amazon and it 's still in the box . too expensive to return . i ended up with a different bed frame . 
hello , this is the information i received from my sales rep today . the unit will go back and recharge , and will start from the beginning , it will not restart where it finished off , will begin again complete room have a nice day and wonderful holiday season 
no hepa , it has and airclean filter ( replace every three months ) . it does come with a remote . you set your modes , the clock , or tell the scout to return to the charging base from here . this also gives you the ability to set a timer for the scout and switch to some of the scout 's other cleaning modes , corner , spot and turbo . 
my rug has 1 inch fringe and it does not . 
not at all . works as advertised . 
yes ... it fits in my 12oz bottles ! 
long enough to drink your beer ! 
all 3 are in 1 box . 
one box ! tip ... ..the beer needs to be cold before you use these since they will not make the beer cold enough unless you like slightly cool beer and also you need to take a good swig out of the bottle before you insert it or else you will have beer spilling out . 
it 's plastic 
the measurements of the flask are 3 and 3 4 inches wide ( straight measure ) and almost 4 inches tall ( straight measure ) . the flask has a slite bow to it and that makes the measurement a little harder to do . it does fit in most of my pockets real nice . 
yes it has a slight curve , it engraves very nicely . 
metal 
i 'm not sure ... . the finish is flat black and the metal wall is thin . it is a very nice flask as it is . 
hey marco , no problems so far for everyday use . although made it china , it seems to be a sturdy flask with a tight seal . the matte finish is a nice touch . hope this helps ! alex

the gps guide 
stops on it 's own after the complete cycle ( exactly where it started ) ... takes about an hour . i 've had mine for 4 months now and use it at least twice a week -- -no longer sneeze . this , ibraava , far surpasses the hopes i had for it . amazing is not an overstatement -- - 
it just makes beeps . no words . musical beeps . 
i can use any cleaning product on my floors . 
no , japan import model . 
sorry ... only in japan . 
hello , how are you ? thank you for your interest in our item . they come in one height only . pierre 
probably only about the thickness shown in the photo - i actually returned mine bc my shelves are a little over an inch thick and the dividers did n't fit . 
yes . press the m ( minutes ) and s ( seconds ) key at the same time . this will clear all previous settings and silence the alarm . 
this timer `` will '' beep during the setting of the time . 
yes , it does , as long as you do n't push both hour and minute buttons to clear it . i love this timer ! it 's loud enough to hear in another room and easy to use . 
no . it 's a count down count up timer 
3 '' long x2.74 '' tall x1 '' deep 
it 's similar to it , the colors are a little different than the one i have but it 's mostly the same . 
dear customer , our items ship from china and delivery time is usually in 8-20 days under normal condition.there is a faster shipping and it will arrive in 3-8 days.but you need add $ 13 extra shipping cost , if you agree . 
center slit for pillow entrance 
the box reads , `` do not cut on the mat '' . 
totally smooth . i keep it rolled up in the box it came in and when it is time to use on the counter , it unrolls and lies flat . no creases and no raised lines on the surface at all , including where the measuring circles are . 
about 14 x 22 inches ; large enough to make a large pizza on . 
picture a sheet of construction paper covered with the silicone . it 's thin but does the job very nicely . 
no 
you can safely purchase the mat and if for any reason it is not for you , please email our top-notch customer service for full refund , no questions asked . cheers ~ sili bake 
i wrote to the company - they say it is stainless steel 
no . 
it 's relatively quick between and hour to an hour and a half . i 've left food in there as long as 4 hrs and it did n't do any more than warm the food . it really is handy 
standard usa 
50w 
i 'm not sure , it 's on my desk at work , but i think it 's about 20 inches . 
disassembled . easy to put together 
table is 17 '' h and stools are 15 '' h 
i will ask my husband tomorrow but i think it is solid wood . we saw it at raymore and flannigan first . and then ordered it online due to it being less money on line . 
hi , thanks for submitting your question . according to the manufacturer website , the height of this table is 36 inches . i hope this helps ! 
i purchased a king duvet cover for my california king bed & i 've had no issue with it . in fact , the quality was great & we love it . 
the cover is 108x98 
i have had this a c unit about a month , i had no problem connecting it to the back of the unit and the window . i did have to take my time as the first time i did not get the hose properly screwed into the window unit , but once i got it right it has stayed together no problem . the unit works very good . the noise level is minimal , on low or medium i do n't have to turn the tv up , on high i have to turn it up two clicks , not bad at all . i would highly recommend this air conditioner ! ! ! 
no , you will just send the moisture back into the basement air . get a real dehumidifier . 
from a $ $ $ perspective , we run ours about 12 hours a day . impact on electric bill is about $ 1 per day . hope this helps . 
it 's not good for steaming other kinds of food because the little drawer is only as high and wide as a hotdog and it 's very flimsy plastic . so most veggies wo n't even fit . if you squeeze food in it wo n't cook well because there are n't enough holes . and the top level is impossible to use since there 's hardly any steam there . sadly , you ca n't boil corn or other things in the bottom level because there 's no room at all . so you ca n't really use it for steaming other foods . 
normal outlet . it 's amazing ! ! ! 
yes 
whatever plastic feathers are in there go through the sheets and stabs my body same with the pillows 
it is goose down . i bought 2 of them and my daughter and i both agree incredibly warm . the only thing that was odd was the bottom part of the blanket you could see the feathers between in the blanket so waiting to see how durable it is . but for right now i would definitely buy a third if my son was living at home instead of at school . 
the newer 8007 8 model is bpa-free , while the 8004 6 is not . the 1st stage of the 2-stage screen sieve is made of steel in the 8007 8 series , while in the older model it 's plastic . guess you could say the new model is more `` heavy duty '' and would be less prone to screen damage in the long run . all in all , the 8007 8 is an upgraded version of the 8004 6 but the upgrades are more subtle than earth-shattering : http : www.youtube.com watch ? v=bvznijwgw2i 
hello , the feed tube is actually the same size . 
yes , my screen had a piece of loose wire on one side and started to come apart quickly . also the part of the `` open '' `` close '' print on the machine wiped off when cleaning . 
the 8007 and 8008 are made in china . amazon offers their warranty on all products , regardless of the warranty they already carry . please ignore amazon 's offer as the omega is already covered by the manufacturer 's warranty . thanks , mike - coolshinystuff 
hi there , this item is a us model that is not designed for use outside of n america on power other than 110 volt . we encourage you to purchase the 220 volt version of this juicer , however , that unit is not currently available as the manufacturer is back ordered for the next 90 days . note use of the 110 volt unit on 220 volt power will void the warranty . we currently do not support shipping this item outside of the us at this time . 
yes plus nut butter and noddles ! 
it is metallic . but not a bright red . 
no , just the large one . no other will work either . 
if the bowl is properly positioned , it spins automatically . there is a lever in the base to change the turntable position ; move it toward the front to accommodate the larger bowl . be sure to insert the beaters dough hooks so the narrower dough hook or the more cone-shaped beater ( with the nylon `` button '' on the bottom ) is against the side of the bowl . read your instruction sheet thoroughly . 
i really do n't know . it was given to a family member as a christmas present . i know they love it and use it a lot but i will get back with you after i contact them . 
i would venture to say the answer is `` no '' because it is to be used only in the us and canada . i searched throughout all of the instructions and nowhere did i find the information you are looking for . they have a website at www.sunbearm.com or you may call their customer service at 1-800-458-8407 ( us ) or 1-800-667-8623 ( canada ) . i am sorry i could not be of more help . hopefully you will contact them ! may you have a blessed day ? 
yes it does spin 
do n't know the exact weight but it 's heavy enough to be stable when using it . it does n't tip over . it was given as a christmas gift so i called the receiptant and that was what she said . she said she liked it very much . 
i have not used the mixer for dough as of yet , , however i did use cookie dough and it seemed to do well using the dough utensils . 
yes 
hi , this just shipping to us now . 
hi this comes only the mattress and boxspring . the stand and headboard is for picture display only thanks 
this is the actual mattress 
absolutely ! ! ! ! ! this is the reason i bought this particular sweeper . just love it and you will too ! 
no the smart charger is sold separately . this one comes with the regular wall charger . 
yes it is nimh battery 
no . 
it is not silent but it is the quietest fan i have ever owned . 
yes 
13 inches 
it does n't say anywhere on the box , fan or manual . it does have the company address located in phoenix , az 
the only difference between these is oem distributor . this product is warranted by ming 's mark inc. dba gowise usa ; another one is maintained by ozeri . +++ i just figure out the original chinese manufacturer is natridy electric appliance ind.co. , ltd . if you 'd like to compare the specifications , `` natridy and nd-668r-35 '' are good keywords for your web-search . 
the top and sides are black . i love mine . best microwave i have ever owned . 
yes 
you can order each once individually i ordered 3 - the starfish , the seahorse , and the tree . you need to order the pillows separate from the covers . i was very impressed with the quality ! 
turquoise 
if you buyer from us , it 's free shipping 
you only need one hand to pump the plunger up and down , but you need to somehow hold the bottle steady - maybe holding it with your arm against your body , or maybe between your knees ? 
just pump 
yes . as long as you 're able to hold the bottle steady with one hand , you can pump the bottle opener with the other hand . 
i have used this twice , and each time yielded approx . 2-1 2 cups . although the end result was relatively tasty , i found it to be way too much time and effort overall , for such a small quantity . prep time alone is at least an hour , followed by all day sitting in the machine , and then several more hours in the refrigerator . 
no it makes both . it takes an extra step to make the greek yogurt ( straining ) . 
everything but the strainer can go into the top shelf of the dishwasher . they are a bit tall so they may not fit in your model but it ca n't hurt to try . the yogurt maker works great but you do need to play with your milk and cooking time preferences to find the blend that works for your palate . good luck ! ! i love mine ! 
your bacteria is live , so you can save some and use it make a new batch usually 4 or 5 times depending on the strength of your bacteria . i use starter from cultures for health for everything instead of the stuff from the store since i discovered some companies use milk from cows fed gmo corn to make their yogurt . 
you should be able to use goats milk and yes you do need a starter . you usually just add 1 cup of yogurt to the milk to act as a starter . 
i have not tried soy milk but regular greek yogurt is awesome 
first of all , sorry for responding so late . it is clearly mentioned in the instructions that it should not be run on water or liquid . it will have problem and might stop working . 
nope . hopefully your cat is agile enough to run away ! ! 
i measured it just now- it sticks out eleven inches from the window . 
open the front of the a c unit on the side facing the room and remove the filter by hand and clean it well with a dry paint brush to remove any pollen lent etc. , i take it outside to do this ... or you can wash it under running cold water if it really needs that much cleaning , but blow it dry with a hair dryer or similar before replacing it . then if the light is still on afterward , press the filter button and it goes off . this light comes on after the air conditioner has operated , i believe the directions said around 1000 hrs. , so it 's automatic , even if you have already cleaned it prior . hope this helps you . 
no , it does not . the inside air handler is a closed system , and does not have any vents that open to outside air . only larger units would have this option , and unfortunately , even those are usually too small to be effective . best option is to open a window elsewhere and put a fan in it to bring in outside air . 
yes and that feature is fantastic . so i set it for 72 while we sleep and move it to 75 during the day . 
these are really great mitts and i 've never felt heat while holding any pots or pans . they are really thick and padded . 
they are very flexible and very comfortable to wear . they provide a good grip too . 
no the lining is not removable . you can turn it inside out and wash . 
no 
no 
two 
they are made of a flexible silicone material with a inner cotton liner that is quilted 
yes , they are really thick . 
it 's like 24 x 63. really big . however it does have neat little borders if you want to cut each map out and frame it . 
it 's actually really easy to read . it being about six feet tall helps . lol 
yes it definitely wood . it is set up for either an clothing armoire our for a tv . 
yes , you can use it for clothing , it comes with a garment rod . there are no shelves that come with the armoire . 
this is a flat pack however it was fairly easy to assemble . it took me a little over an hour to assemble 
from the top of the molding to the armoire `` feet '' , it is 71 inches tall 
no 
yes . and it is a great unit . 
used it for a replacement bar stool works great , i believe it will fit most standard bar stools not sure of thickness . 
thanks for asking . the manufacturer does n't rate the swivels for specific loads . this is because there are many factors that go into that equation based on the individual chair or stool application . load ratings like this are normally set by the manufacturer of the chair or stool . we can tell you that these are very high quality swivels that are made in the usa to top quality specifications . unlike many swivels , these have a full race set of ball bearings and are pre-lubricated . many others have fewer ball bearings resulting in a partially full track that does n't last as long . - the chairpartsonline sales team 
yes 
no it is not ... hope this helped . 
yes 
just the feet ... easy 
yes , perhaps even 2 . 
approximately 3 ' x 21.25 '' x 8.5 '' deep 
dark brown 
firm 
it 's a polyester blend , easy to clean 
it is 22 inches wide and 38 inches long and 17 inches high . the storage is 8 inches deep . 
i 'm not quite sure how to answer that . for everyone it would be different . when i first got on it , i thought it would be to soft . but when you settle in , its so perfect for me . i am 5'8 160 lbs and my hubby is 6'5 280 lbs . we are both extremely happy with it . i would totally give it a few days to get used to though . especially if you have never used memory foam before . i can say honestly , if i had to make the choice again i totally would choose this mattress . the squishy side thing is the only thing to get over , which i have . hope that helps . k 
if the platform bed has a solid wood surface for the mattress it will perform the best for you . if the bed frame had wide spaced slats or rails , buy some plywood to use as a base under the mattress . platform beds with very close spaced slats should work well with this mattress . 
yes . but i would recommend a bed frame with a middle support bar . 
compressed rolled up an in rectangular shaped box . basically open plastic roll it out let it expand before using mine only took a few hours to expand fully , opened in the afternoon and used that night . 
i just put a mattress cover on , it does n't need any extra padding . 
i believe it said it should be used within 6 months . but it should remained closed until use . 
i would think that you could . i worked at a dairy queen that made ice cream cakes and we put edible images like these on ice cream cakes all the time and they did fine . make sure the cake is frozen really hard . 
it depends on the shipping method you use . you can expedite to 2 days or even next day which would be 24 hours . either way your item ships same day if before 3pm mst . thank you ! 
just message me immediately after purchase with the text you would like written . thank you ! 
they are however there is always the risk of cross contamination . thank you ! 
i ship usually 24 hours as long as i receive your personalization request . the estimated delivery time is usually 3-5 business days using first class shipping 
the flexible part is about 44 '' , so overall just about 4 feet from plug to tip of probe . i believe you can order additional or replacement probes with longer cords if needed , but this length is more than sufficient for our ovens at home . 
i have n't found it to be a problem . you have to be careful to close the oven door so as not to break or bend the wire . 
yes . 
yes , at the tip of the probe , just the narrower , pointed 3 4 in . or so . 
yes it comes with a clip to attach to top of pan . must protect cable from burner heat , ie keep away from flame . 
it does not have a clock but has a timer . 
i 'm not sure but it does produced some smell if you are 2 square feet from the area not whole a lot because o3 is very unstable . it evaporates right away . 
hi julia , i personally do n't drink the ozonated type water ; however i am also not going to say i 'm for or against drinking this type of water . i have spent time , money and practiced drinking `` ionized water '' , it seems to be essentially going after the same outcome : reduce free radicals in the body . that part i 'm wholeheartedly on board with . i did a youtube search , sure enough , there is a good video on a guy making ozonated water . i 've coped and pasted the link for you : https : www.youtube.com watch ? v=b-bdhv4kcf8 
o3 is poisonous . you do not want to breathe it in.. 
it work at 110v electricity , not 220v . 
hi matthew , happy to help . this unit covers approximately 4000 sq ft. of space depending on the existing air quality of the space . i hope this helps and please let us know if we can possibly help with anything else : ) . 
hi robert , glad to help : ) . all ozone generators require an ozone plate or cartridge in order to work . ozone ( activated oxygen , o3 ) is created when voltage is applied to the ozone plate cartridge to create a corona discharge . this corona discharge reacts with the oxygen present in the ozone generator chamber to create ozone . i hope this helps and please let us know if we can help with anything else : ) . 
waite at least one hour . i this on a 45 foot motor yacht to kill mold and odor . 
glad to assist : ) . as a safety pre-caution , this ozone generator does not have a continuous run feature . this is because very highly concentrated levels of ozone can be a respiratory irritant , so more ozone is not always necessarily better . however , ozone does dissipate quickly and converts back to oxygen and this unit does have a timer function with a max 2 hour run time that is more than sufficient for most odor removal applications . the timer can be reset immediately after it ends , in the event that a 2nd purification treatment is needed . i hope this helps and please let us know if there are any additional questions we can help answer : ) . thanks ! 
hi j , the ozone plate cartidge is made of ceramic . yes , this ozone generator will kill airborne mold spores and eliminate odor for a period of time . however , no ozone generator on the market ( no matter what a manufacturer will tell you ) will eliminate all mold spores in a contaminated area . this is because mold spores can hide in nooks and crannies in interior surfaces such as inside drywall and other porous material like clothing etc . that may not necessarily be reached by ozone purification . generally , ozone purification treatment is used after conventional mold clean-ups that involve a bleach scrubbing of contaminated surfaces . i hope this helps and please let us know if we can help with anything else : ) . 
not sure what you mean by a vent fan but it does not vent like a range hood . it does however apparently draw air in through the rear and exhaust it out the front . there 's a grille area in the front below the door opening about 1 '' high and extends from left to right across the front of the unit . air is pushed out there . i read somewhere in previous ge units the air was vented in the rear and may have overheated the unit or at least shortened the life of the mechanical components especially if it was housed in an enclosed space . this unit is about 1 `` or so higher than the units it replaced . 
yes ! pem31dfbb 
dear steve , this model is designed as a countertop unit . however , ge does advise that you can purchase the 04-a019 hanging kit if you wish to hang this unit from the underside of a cabinet . 
you 're probably cooking it too long . watch and listen as the corn pops . when the rate of popping slows down [ see directions on bag ] , stop the microwave and note the time used to get to that point . check your popcorn to see how much is still unpopped and whether it is burnt . with a little experimentation you can get a nice result . i 've never been able to pop all the kernels without burning , but you can remove the popped corn and then tape up the bag and return the unpopped kernels for more heating . 
about 4 ' feet 
three feet . fyi -- it 's the best microwave i 've ever had -- pretty quiet . 
yes - it is very well made and the lid has nice finish and fits perfectly . we are very pleased overall with our purchase - although this was without a doubt the largest griddle we have ever owned . 
says made in china . 
in general , i believe that most zojirushi products are manufactured in the main factories in japan . however , they have a user-friendly website and i 'm sure they will tell you via e-mail regarding this particular unit . 
23.75 in x 14.5 in 
hi larry , the zojirushi electric griddle dcc10 is 1350w as per the manufacture . 
you can cook all of those things , easily . 
none of the above , i 've looked everywhere on all parts 
there is a recessed area all around the surface to catch some drippings . it could get overfull but that is not too likely . 
i would n't . i 've gone through 2 covers in less than a year . one to the wash and one to wear and tear . the fabric and seams are horrible . 
i do n't know what are you talking about it ? i did n't say anything . it is great . my granddaughter love it.. oh well my husband and i noticed that real small couch for expensive price . whoa . that cost should be forty dollars.. 
best for children 4 or younger 
34 inch length for child to lay upon . not including the back rest . 
unfinished . 
yes . i am 5'6 '' and when i stand next to it the top of the shelf is parallel to my lower neck , where the clavicle bones meet . great shelf , i love mine . perfect for my college books and jewelry etc . 
16 and 1 8 inch inside dimension , width . 11.5 inch deep . ( heights are adjustable ) 
medium to firm . you tell there 's a lot of support but the top layer is nice and soft . i like a firmer bed , my husband likes a softer bed but we both sleep great on it ! 
medium firm 
no it is a primary mattress and it is awesome . 
within the first three hours it looks like a mattress but i waited twenty four hours before sleeping on it and at that time it was fully expanded.i have been quite pleased with the mattress so far.six months of use 
yes you can ... i bought one a raised metal frame for mine ... that would work fine 
i do n't know what its rated for , but i think 70lbs would be ok. its probably close to the limit but all you would need is different hooks . the rack is easy to install and looks awesome . 
it has 4 separate hooks and it stays balanced just fine . i 've only had it for about two months , but have not noticed any issues . 
i think it just depends on how you reinforce it in your ceiling . i reinforced mine with crossing 2x4s in the rafters . i would be confident with the extra care it would hold at least some cast iron . 
1 1 2 '' x 18 '' x 24 '' 
you can , they have them shown on the instruction manual . i do n't have it with me . 
mine came with everything needed to put it up . biggest challenge was finding studs for the screw eyes in the location where we wanted it to hang over our island counter space . the chain supplied was twice as long as we needed to position it for easy access . 
quite a bit i have 8 pans on hooks all my spoons whisks cheese graters and on top i have pot my cast iron pans up there but what i did was made sure i used the beams in the ceiling you ca n't just put it up you have to find those studs i love it 
no 
i believe the product description states 33 # . personally i would not exceed 20 # ( more or less ) . i really do like the pot rack . now that my `` pot supply '' is so handily & readily available , i find i am using pans i 've had for years but just did n't want to have to dig them out of the pile . would absolutely recommend this item . 
the issue is going g to be more of how you plan on attaching the brackets and to what type of surface . otherwise this is pretty sturdy and supports a full set of my pans without any concern . 
maximum holding weight is 33 lbs 
the hooks can be in any of the 5 rows of gaps . 
no it does not 
it is plastic so needs no liner . 
nope . 
i 'm not sure if it 's pvc free . it 's a thick vinyl material . it 's made well and gives me something extra to smile at each day . 
it 's very lightly frosted which means it 's somewhat see thru 
no , just the curtain . 
70 '' x72 '' 
no it does not - back rest folds down to create the bed . 
no not even close . i do n't recommend this very poor quality . 
it does not have pockets on the sides . it seems to be a nice sofa , but very uncomfortable . 
there is none after 30 days . mine broke after 3 months . have not been able to find someone who can fix it . 
95 to 185 and no you ca n't use it without heat . 
hi , it has 10 trays and the tray 's are chrome-plated with stainless steel and the whole thing are stainless steel . 
super q dehydrator model : pt-40 
i 'm not sure as we sent it to a rear shop to be fixed.it never worked but 2 hours.we were very unhappy with amazon and the people it came from.this was a christmas gift that did n't work and to expensive . to be treated so bad they did n't stand behind their product 
i bought it and have n't used it yet . it 's a replacement for another type that burned up in a fire . i will not have another plastic one though as i found them hard to clean and not as durable . 
dehydrator outside dimensions : 17 '' w x 20.5 '' d x15.5 '' h ; 10 trays : each 16 '' w x 14.5 '' d ( 2320 sq . inches total drying space vice advertised 2400 . ) 
yes the are and they are made very sturdy . very easy to clean i am very pleased with mine . mitch 
it is made in china 
it comes with a 3m adhesive hook or a screw in dry wall hook . we bought a sturdier hook at a local hardware store just to be safe since we placed over our babies crib . 
yes . this thing is super light . however , if the lace gets sat on , and thus pulled , that hook likely would n't hold up . the one it comes with did pretty good as long as you mount in a stud . 
it didnt say . i have to say though i was sewing butterflies on the netting and the thread could get lost . it looks great and doesnt seem large but again i did have difficulty getting those butterflies to stay . i hope this helps somewhat . 
i am using it in full but sure it would fit in queen also . 
yes , it will fit around a king bed . no , there is no hardware . i bought a white screw-in hook to mount on my white ceiling and it worked nicely . when i take the housweety down for the winter , the hook in the ceiling is barely noticeable . 
yes it does . i have around only the top of my daughters bed . she loves it ! 
we have yet to travel with it , but i feel it is on the heavy side for such . the wireless feature is nice , and the light is a bright white , not yellow like others . it 's not cheap , but it is well-made . if you want the best , buy it . if you are on a budget , there are other products available for a fraction of the cost . 
you can pick hop usb wall chargers in most stores that sell cell phone accessories . i just use my ipad charger currently ( no pun intended ) . 
the magnification on this mini mirror is 10x ; it 's 5x on the larger mirror . i actually use both mirrors . i guess i 'm blind as a bat ! 
dear regina , the dimensions for the mini sensor mirror are 5.7 '' width x 4.5 '' depth x 11.7 '' height . best , simplehuman 
yes and no , it has 2 height settings . mirror is attached at about 2 '' from the top . if you rotate the mirror it is now attached 2 '' from the bottom making the mirror about 3 '' taller . 
no , it does not . that is the only downside of this mirror . i take a small compact with a mirror to use with it when i travel . 
not sure . i am taking mine to greece and croatia . i will be taking a converter as well . once the mirror is charged up , it will run for several hours on its own power , cordlessly . make sure to leave for your trip with it fully charged and you may make it the whole trip without needling to recharge ! 
i had the same problem . simplehuman did n't tell me why it stopped working but they replaced it immediately . i had my invoice number , receipts , etc ... i also previously registered the product on their website . i chose to exchange the product through simplehuman which meant i purchased a second mirror on their website . i used the packaging from the new mirror and shipped out the broken mirror with all of my receipts . this exchange took all of 3 days -- my credit card was credited the following week . 
yes a straw is included 
yes no prob 
no way lulu ... ... it 's a bubba keg ! ! ! you could put it on the passenger seat and it will sit just right . 
yes it does 
carla , my mixer is the `` artisan '' tilt back head mixer . unless you have the large professional mixer with the arms that hold the bowl then the cover should fit yours . mine came with the standard stainless steel bowl and i bought a glass 5 quart bowl also . i love this cover , it has a zipper that makes it easy to put on and fits like a glove . 
no ! 
just perfect 
yes it will fit . same mixer just a different series of colors . 
good place to keep the booklet that comes with the kitchen aid but can also hold a couple of the mixing attachments . 
the mixer i bought is a k45ss , it 's the only number i have since it came from a consignment shop and i do n't have a box or any paperwork . the cover does fit and i 'm able to close the zipper in the back . i hope this helps . 
your kitchen aid looks very similar to mine and should definitely fit . i can measure my mixer and advise , if you like ! 
it is a heavy duty insulated plastic , dish washer safe ( i only place it on the top rack , however ) . i can honestly tell you this is one of the best purchases i ever made . the glasses keep cold things cold and warm thing warm . my elderly mother lives with us and she , my husband and i all love them and highly recommend them . 
all four sides have bas-relief images or text -- no room for a decal bigger than 1 '' square . 
yes 
i 'm not sure . i actually found these cheaper at walmart & returned them for a different size . they are not the same size openings as the mason jars i currently have though . 
no ! on the bottom it says : do not microwave , but it also says that you can put it on the top rack of a dishwasher ( maybe you wanted to know too ) . 
i use it as a circulation tool in a 21x30 room and it has lowered the temp by 4 degrees over just using the a c. works , well 
does only cold . if i recall , dyson discontinued the model with both heat & cold . 
120v 60hz 0.8 a hope that helps ! great fan 
the light is n't dimmable , and you ca n't disable it . 
no 
it does not beep at all , changing speeds , turning on or off , or oscillating 
it is a lightweight stool , not meant for sitting , but i 've gotten away with sitting on it for storytime to my kids each night . so far , months later , it 's still good . 
yes and it is nice . i want to get another one but the colors are limited . i want brown . i have white and red . 
the legs are black . 
yes , the 9.5 inches includes the height of the feet . ray 
9 1 2 inches 
hi , thanks for posting . i 've searched our catalog and it appears that the only color available in this particular style of footrest stool is white . however , you may be interested in a different style footrest stool by the same manufacturer . you can have a look at them here : 
i put mine in the dishwasher and have had no problems . 
it only comes with a devil egg holder for one tier . it is in 2 pieces and i think each piece holds 12 pieces . not sure but maybe you can buy additional deviled egg trays ... . 
24 eggs 
we do often do sweet potatoes , but have done them a few times and yes it does work well . i love mine so much i bought one for my brother . i 'm sure you will enjoy yours . 
yes no problem . 
a good sized baked potato - 5 to 6 inches long with a good size girth . but the bigger the potato the more effort you need to push it threw . it is a good machine . 
absolutely ; you have to make sure you buy both the blade , and the grid for that size . popping the blade and grid off is a breeze , and should be done after each use for cleaning anyways . 
i assume you mean waffle fries , no , this is a french fry cutter , you need a mandolin for that 
there is only one glove per package . the glove can be used on either hand . 
i use it to bbq to handle the grill and it work good 
just one and it 's kinda bulky , not like a regular glove , but works great ! 
one and they great gloves 
there is a cover with a zipper , but i do n't think you 'd want to try to remove it . i 've had 2 of these mattresses for 3.5 years and they are in perfect condition . if you want extra covering on the mattress that is washable i would suggest a thin mattress cover . 
i bought this combination and have been sleeping on them for about a week now . perfect match and i love both ! 
product details size : queen product dimensions : 80 x 60 x 8 inches 
it is soft but not too soft . i find that it is just the perfect comfort for me . it gives some when you lay on it . but not to the point where you are unable to move , it other words you do n't feel like you fell in a massive hole and ca n't get out ! lol ! but it is just the right amount of comfort ! 
yes it comes in a box about 3 feet long by approx a foot wide 
hi jennifer the dimensions of the cube are 1 inch square . 
hi , yes they are bpa free , thanks . 
hi d. brush , the size of each cube is 1.06 '' height x 0.93 '' x 0.93 '' inches square , hope this is ok for you , thanks . 
it is 16 1 2 inches long , and 6 inches wide . 
16.5 x 6 x 2 it 's written in the ad on the lower part of the website page . 
it is an inch and a half and solid . works well for my husbands sports jacket . 
one 
yes lol 
fixed 
i would get the hamilton beach square because you can control the temperature 
inside dimensions it 's 11 '' x 7 '' . it can fit 3 medium pork chops without bone across or 4 small ( 3 across and one sideways beneath it ) . cooks evenly no matter where you place meat or poultry on grill . hope this helps . 
dont eat the plastic ... it 's really undigestable . 
i 'm not sure but is silicone and it peels off of fondant so it might work . sorry wish i could be more help 
i have not tried it but you should be able to pour sugar in it 
we used ours for soap molds and it worked well . we have not tried any other additional uses for this mold . 
its a little tricky but you just pull down on the top . its just that it really sticks the first few times . i was afraid i was going to break mine but a brave friend just pulled hard and it opened . good luck ! 
never measured it but i would say 2 dt may be 
yes- all four pictures are on the cup 
there is only 1 tumbler . it is a great tumbler and recommend it if you are a golden girl fan . 
yes 
the newisland replacement filters are available on amazon now . normally replace filter about every two to three months ( depending on use and local water quality ) . it can work with most type of water bottle . simply place the device on any bottles without screwing it on , still works ! hope this will help ! 
the satechi ones do not work ! i thought they might and they are too thin and have a hard plastic case . i found a web site for the humidifier and will be emailing them to see if they have replacements . the product comes with 2 filters and us und distilled water i have n't had to replace yet . 
i dont think so . it sits on top of a water bottle and there is no reservoir that you can put the oils in . 
it has blue light when you plug the usb cable with the computer , and it turns off if you unplug it . 
it is best for space under 108 square feet . any small room is ok 
yes 
shiny 
it is not totally flat . it has a raised ring around the bottom and then flattens out . so , if you were to back a cake and turn it upside down , you would have an indent on the cake bottom where the pan is raised . the ring is about 1 2 inch wide and about 1 2 inch in from outside of the pan . 
yes 
it feels like a heavier cotton , very nice and comfortable . hope this helps 
i think it 's some cotton and polyester 
thanks for your interest . we have been granted rights to ship to canada and all over the world we are just waiting on the legal documents . i 'd say we are about 2 3 weeks away . keep checking ! david president of sales legends home bedding

i just got a set that is white with a brown pattern from a local retailer 
i think it depends on the type of pet . however , we have two large dogs and it seems to brush off easily . 
they seem to be . i 've been using them for awhile now and have held up quite well and make my moscow mules quite tasty . 
india 
no , it would take away the mugs character 
yes , as with all of them it will wear off quickly . aged copper mugs are the norm for me . 
yes , packaged well in plastic and foam . 
copper , through and through as far as i know . 
i would say yes . the amount of water determines how long the eggs cook . the number of eggs does n't enter into the equation . 
it is 1 year . it broke in 6 months . 
you can use only 1 tier if you have only a few eggs that you want cooked . i have made eggs using single and both tiers with no problem . i have also cooked chinese dumplings using one tier , the best cook time is with the water level between medium and hard . 
yes . i generally set a timer for about 17 minutes then turn it off myself , just because i do n't want to forget and it does n't have any sort of beeper . once the water boils out it turns itself off . 
i also emailed mr. coffee about this directly . unfortunately , the short answer is `` no , it is not bpa-free . '' i have pasted the email reply i received underneath the product webpage link for this model , so if you wish you can verify that there is no mention of bpa-free plastic : http : www.mrcoffee.com iced-tea-makers bvmc-tm33.html -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - thank you for contacting mr. coffee , a brand of jarden consumer solutions . in response to your inquiry regarding bvmc-tm33 ; unless it is listed on the website , it is not bpa free . at jarden consumer solutions ( jcs ) , we are committed to producing trusted household products that meet or exceed applicable product standards . bpa is a key component in the production of polycarbonate plastics . polycarbonates ( pc ) are used in a variety of applications in the appliance industry where strength , durability and clarity are required . bpa is also present in certain thermo set epoxies used in coatings , adhesives , paints , etc . phthalates are primarily used in vinyl to make the material more pliable flexible . a vast majority of our products are made from bpa free plastics such as polypropylene ( pp ) , acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene ( abs ) , styrene-acrylonitrile ( san ) , high impact polystyrene ( hips ) , polyethylene ( pe ) , etc . and inorganic materials such as glass , which do not contain bpa . currently , polycarbonates ( pc ) continue to be recognized as safe for food contact applications by the united states food and drug administration ( fda ) . jcs purchases polycarbonates ( pc ) from trusted suppliers , who monitor to ensure what they sell complies with all current federal , state and local health and safety regulations . we appreciate your business and are happy to help if you have any further questions or concerns . sincerely , gordon jarden consumer solutions 
it holds 92 ounces to the ice mark on the pitcher , and 96 ounces to what i consider the max ( bottom of the pouring lip ) . 
the tea that it brews does come out hot ; which is why you have ice or cold water in the bottom of the glass pitcher prior to pushing the brew button . if you are looking to make hot tea ( and not specifically iced ) there are other electric tea pots kettles on the market that would probably work much better . i have seen one or two where you can actually select the desired hot brewing temperature ... .which is a great feature . anyway , i hope that this information helps . 
sorry it has taken so long to get back to you on your question . i had to go pull the box and the information booklet on it to find the answer to your question on whether this is bpa free . the answer is , i am not sure . there is nothing on any of the documentation that would say that either the basket nor the water storage unit are bpa free . in other things that i have purchased in the past that have been bpa free it has had it clearly labeled on the box and then further explained within the literature inside of the manuals , but this does not mention any information on it being bpa free . so for that , i can not vouch . you may want to check with mr. coffee directly for that particular information . i wish i could have been more help to you on this one ! take care ! 
yes , the backing is 100 % polyurethane . 
queen is back in stock . 
i think it would work fine and give you extra protection for your mattress . we tend to spill coffee in the early morning and the mattress cover has been helped prevent stains . 
probably not . however if you spray it down with some vinegar full strength , and air it out for a few days , that might kill off some of the old dog smell . 
i would think so . ours is high and there 's still room is need be . 
yes 
you raise a good point , although do n't you mean anaerobic bacteria like botulism ? the thing is , clostridium botulinum is dangerous in foods which are either too high of a ph ( like green beans ) or which have n't been cooked at high enough temperature ( greater than 185 degrees fahrenheit for at least 5 minutes ) . whether this product will do that i ca n't say - unfortunately i have n't had a chance to use it yet because just recently i finally gave up on receiving the converter from them and went on amazon and bought it myself . i personally would n't worry about botulism with this device , especially since the vacuum will ( theoretically , at least ) raise the boiling point of water high enough to heat the steam to at least 212 degrees fahrenheit . 
do n't even bother about buy this item , it wo n't keep your food hot , unless is plugged . 
is not for cooking , is for heating 
it does n't technically cook food . it reheats . if you mean something like a lean cuisine then yes , it will work for that . it heats food in plastic , glass or metal . i vacuum seal a lot of food and it reheats just fine in that bag . hope this helps . 
i just emailed the company tonight , i was wondering the same ... `` draws 45 watts '' : - ) 
it worked great in the car . 
i used mine several times to heat up jimmy dean breakfast bowls . i would place the retail box in the mini at bed time , plug it in and enjoy the breakfast in the morning . worked great , so i figured i could make my own breakfast as well using three wisked eggs , some diced onions green peppers and a little sausage . i use a pyrex container with lid and place the mixture in the mini before i go to bed , plug it in , and in the morinig i have a great hot breakfast . 
i used the rubbermaid `` take alongs '' which fit perfectly in the portable oven . it has a red lid . it holds 4 cups . that will give you an idea of portion size as well . 
it takes 1 hour to heat refrigerated food completely .food comes out steaming as if it was just cooked ! worth every penny 
amazon has a version that includes smart base brackets for the headboard and footboard . make sure you get that version . if you made the mistake i did and ordered this one without the brackets , they can be ordered separately from the company . 
yes you may , but you do n't have to place a box spring as this product can replace old box spring and bed frame . 
its not an adjustable frame but it is firm straight out of the box . 
it does not squeak at all ! ! ! 
probably . make sure you count all the legs . btw i still would n't buy it 
the top center of the lid is plastic to allow you to push to close without burning yourself . therefore the inside circle part if the lid is also plastic . the rest of the lid is stainless steel inside and outside and so is the entire container . 
the box shown on amazon says 1500w 
no , 110 is what this uses . 
china great looking very poor quality buy a breville cost more but oh my is great my mother use to say you get what you pay for good luck 
as soon as the water reaches a rolling boil , the unit shuts off and stops heating , so one could say that the water begins to cool at that very point . it is not a thermal carafe , so the water will eventually cool off . however , it literally takes only seconds for the water to reach a boil again if the user switches it back on . we 've been quite pleased with this unit and actually wish we 'd bought it or one like it sooner . 
no 
no it does n't 
yes , the plastic water level window . 
we are not sure , check the manufacturers website or contact them directly for the country of origin . 
hello , this is not machine washable . you would need to spot clean the blanket . we do have a full 90 day warranty though . if you spill something on your blanket or it stops working , it can be sent back to us for a free replacement . thank you , sunbelt products 
i 'm not sure , but it def was n't what i was expecting either and i hate you ca n't wash it . : - ( 
hi isabella , our blanket is spot wash only and can not be put into a washer . thanks ! sunbelt products 
i weight 215-230ish works fine for me and my gf . 
no , its very firm , we do n't have a box spring , just the mattress , and it feels great . its still firm and yet soft , at the same time even after two little girls using it as a trampoline when they think we 're not watching . 
i 'd probably go u 
the product dimensions are as follows . 14 inches x 2 inches x 7 inches 
i did receive the free over the door rack ! 
no it is not . i 'm sorry . 
we have static tested the beds to a weight limit of 300 lbs . 
hi mr. flory , the height of lowest setting on the rail is 12 '' from the ground to the top of the rail . the lowest height of a 6 1 2 '' mattress only on the lowest setting from ground to top of the mattress is 13 1 2 '' . if you have any further questions please contact us at 435-565-4490. thanks lightheaded beds customer service 
the frame has adjustable side rails so it can be used with a mattress only or a mattress and box spring . you can just adjust the rails to your preferred height . roll-out slats are also included with the purchase . 
why would you want to ? ? ? if you are referring to flashpoint by adorama it is a bowens mount already . you just unfold and mount to your flashpoint strobe . just so you know bowens , travelite , calumet and flashpoint all use the same mount ( bowens `` s '' type ) . 
this is built around flash lights not continuous . the material is not heat resistant and the beauty dish would limit the amount of light output by the unit . also , the bowens mount is intended for flash heads . 
hey there ! the phottix luna 27.5 '' folding beauty dish includes a bowens speed ring which can attached to all paul c buff products . however , you can not use the paul c buff speed ring with this as it 's already configured and collapsible with the bowens speed ring . hope this helps ! 
i use and recommend the neewer s-type bracket holder with bowens mount for speedlite flash ( available on amazon around $ 20 ) . it 's far easier to mount and operate than the other bowens speedlite adaptors . 
if your promaster lights have a bowens type mount they will work . 
yes , but not for the inside . it 's covers the front of the beauty dish . 
i do n't , but wanted to add that i have two broken rods and have only used it a few times . i love the product but for the breakage . 
sure , you 'd just have to obtain the disk . 
i would have to say maybe so , but in smaller chunks . 
gently twist , it 's like a quarter twist and pull for both the handle to the lid and handle to the stick blender . it 's initially sticky out of the box . 
the handles are of average length . if you 're asking if the handles are extra long like a bbq grill utensil then no . 
yes . this is a very nice set of spatula . i am very happy with it . 
they are very lightweight ! ! the bags fold up to about the size of a small clutch- and snap shut . all contained and perfect for on-the-go ! put k37652 in the search box on the q v c website for a video ! 
approx 16 '' l x 7 '' w x 15 '' h- the strap drop is 11 '' 
i do n't know if there is an established weight limit , but i have carried some pretty heavy loads - 2 2-liter bottles of soda plus 2 large bottles of cranberry juice plus assorted small items in one bag - with no problem . 
less than one pound on my bathroom scales . 
yes , the highest point of vac is 4 inches . 
it can stretch about 7-8 ft. i did not have time to measure it so that is an estimate but at least 7ft . 
you just have to look them up . the base model does not have the canister lift off . the middle model ( professional ) the canister lifts off and the top of the line the canister comes with a little base with wheels . one may be an older year model . 
it should just snap back in when you align it properly and push down . 
35 feet 
yes . it works on iphone4s or any newer iphone . thanks 
since iphone5s is running on ios7 or later release , our product is fully compatibile with ios7 on iphone4s iphone5 iphone5c iphone5s . if you still have more concerns , please email us at support @ wit-eshop.com . thanks steve your support 
no . it syncs with its own app . ios only , not for android . that is the down side ... but for the price is good so far . you just enter manually ... and that could probably be once a week ... 
sorry i do not know . i use wit scale app 
23 inches or 1'11 almost two . cheers ! yes , i 'm a dork and did use a measuring tape . haha ! 
apparently there are 2 height sizes of bar stool . i do n't know the height but it is adjustable and fits the lowest height of counter bar . 
a person with about a 42 '' hip measurement could sit comfortably . the sitting space between the arms is about 17 '' 
250lbs or less 
24 '' to 33 '' 
china 
it is only set for 120v 60 cycle power as far as the unit i purchased . i am not aware of a 220v unit . 
unfortunately k-cups are n't compatible with the nespresso machine . 
i have only used regular whole milk , with that said i would think it would work fine . 
yes it works great 
no 
typically with a variety pack . 
yes . i gave a gas range and use them on there . just be aware the top of the handle is steel but there is a plastic liner on the bottom to leave the handles cool to the touch . if you have the flame up too high and it goes up the sides of the pot it will melt your handles . if you keep the temp right , the handles are great ! 
does n't really say anywhere , but what i do find leads me to believe switzerland . i can tell you it is very good cookware . i love my set . 
i would be hesitant to personally , but the packaging does say `` dishwasher safe . '' 
i had a pan by a different maker and ruined the lid within a few days . i did not get the instruction booklet with this cookware so i am careful with the lids . i do not put them in the dishwasher . certainly not in the oven . i wash them by hand . they are ok , just not my preference . 
yes . flat bottomed stainless steel . i bought them specifically to use on an induction stove . 
hi cassie , i believe that the answer is yes ! all the pots have handles that your pot rack should easily accommodate . the two saucepans have holes in the ends of their handles that measure approximately .3 '' by .4 '' . i do n't know the size of the hangers on your pot rack , but if those openings were too small to fit , you could always go to a hardware or home store and purchase and eyelet with a hook ( that is smaller in diameter and your pot rack arm ) . you would then slip the eyelet over your pot rack arm and then use the smaller hook end to hang the pan . you just need to make sure that the hook is small enough in diameter ( less than .4 '' by .3 '' ) to fit inside the hole of the saucepan . of course it may be possible that you might still need to store the lids and accessories somewhere else . my experience is that buying through amazon ( and costco ) gives you an excellent return policy , so if you did n't like them or they did n't fit your pot rack , you should be able to return them . i love cooking with these pans , they heat so evenly ( i use them on my magnetic induction rangetop ) . hope this helps , my apologies for not getting back to you earlier cassie , when you live on a lake you 're slammed by company all summer long ! sincerely , phil 
the large plate from edge to edge is 9 3 4 inches but the actual area for food is about 6.5 inches . the small plates edge to edge is 7 inches then 4.5 for food area . the small bowl is 5.5 edge to edge and about 2 inches deep . the larger bowl is kinda weird . i like this set as a whole taut the lager bowl is shallow . edge to edge it is 8 inches but i feel like it seems more like a deep plate than a bowl . it seems to be about 1.5 inches deep . the mugs are average in size i feel . the width at the top is 3 inches . it is about 3.75 inches deep . the widest part of the handle is 1 inch so if you have big hands it may be kinda small . hope this helps . 
full size about 10inch plates , the set is actually really nice especially for the price 
i just received these and put them into the dishwasher and have not measured the dinner plates . they seem to be a satisfactory sized for a dinner plate , though . 
after few months of use they are no marks 
they are made in china 
the plates are not heavy , moderate weight , just right for the microwave too . 
yes ... .some of the plates have already starting `` chipping '' ... .but i have 5 kids and they are probably alittle harder on them than i am ... .meh ... 
hi janie , they are bright white ! very nice set . diane s . 
yes they are microwave , dishwasher and also oven safe 
about 22.5 inches 
i 'm not home to measure it but it 's appx 10 inches deep 
65 inches 
29+ inches high x 45 inches wide 
no it does n't ... 
yes , it 's 48 '' . it 's a very nice desk . 
it 's 30 '' to the top of the main desk surface . 
yes for the top rack 
yes 
if you want to strain the yogurt to separate out the whey , these strainers are not fine enough mesh , i think . i use them constantly for kefir . 
yes 
this is difficult to answer for sure , but i do n't think the resins used in this would contain bpa . first is the mesh part of the strainer , which is supposed to be nylon ( probably nylon 6 ) . then the surrounding structure and handle appear to be either polypropylene or polyethylene ( no # 7 recycling symbol or other symbol is molded into mine ) . to my knowledge , none of these three resins are associated with bpa , which is more commonly found in polycarbonate ( and maybe polystyrene ) resins . 
yes , they seem sturdy enough to do that . 
they 're not plastic . they 're nylon . 
not really . it can sit there cockeyed with the handle angled downwards . the small one is perfect , however , for a 2-cup glass measuring cup . the larger one is perfect for a 4-cup glass measuring cup . they both sit anchored and level . 
both are able to be used . i would n't buy it though . broke almost instantly and hamilton beach & amazon wouldnt refund it . 
yes you can 
yes , it does 
we have used our 2-way coffee brewer from hamilton beach for about a month now . you can not brew both sides at the same time since there is a control knob that you use to select either multi-serve or single serve and not both at the same time . we were a little surprised to learn after receiving our two-way that the upright pictured coffee mug was not included in the shipment . we complained about misleading packaging to amazon , the non-amazon supplier , and hamilton beach but no satisfaction about misleading packaging and received a comment `` not included '' to brush us off . unfortunately , hamilton beach is the only supplier of 2-way coffee brewers that we could find that also supported k-cups on the single serve side . be careful since this unit is sort of flimsy plastic and perhaps not very durable . 
height 13.5 inches by 9inches deep by 10inches wide . 
it holds from 1 cup to 2 cups depending on how big a cup you want . 
the newer model is slightly larger , but weighs less than 14lbs . which is 8.3lbs . less it has 2 additional brushes which are specially designed to cover sealed hardwood floors and tile & grout . 360 clean : spinscrub technology gently washes and scrubs hard floors from all angles . wash , scrub & dry : switching between options is a snap . cleanboost control applies extra detergent to stains and heavy traffic areas . 11.5 '' removable nozzle provides a combined squeegee and suction to quickly dry . removable for easy cleaning . it uses several different hoover cleaning solutions , the hoover multi-floorplus 2x concentrated is great and you do n't need much unless the floors are a high-traffic area or very dirty . there are solutions designed for use cleaning grout and another for wood floors . i like that it leaves the floor so dry that there are no steaks and so clean that you can feel the difference with your bare feet . as i said , i did n't have the previous version , all the technical information i found on different web sites and the last is my personal opinion and observation . i have other brands that called their brands ( shark , bissell and others ) that said they were cleaners or sanitizers and all they did was much around hot , dirty water . the only difference between them and mopping is that they were easier to push around , the water remained hot , and you were not bending over to wring it out . even the ones that said they dried the floors , did not unless you went over them at least at least three times ( it varied , depending on the humidity level ) . there is nothing worse than pulling up water that is not clean after you have used the machine at least twice . it is discouraging and disgusting . that is why i love this one , it cleans using very little of the 2x solution ( a small bottle is included ) and then removes the water leaving you with a clean , dry floor without streaks . it is lightweight and i am nor writhing in pain when i finish . 
kimo , i think the machine does a good job with the grout cleaning , but i do have one extenuating circumstance . i purposely used dark gray grout when we had this tile installed . this is a high traffic area plus where we feed two dogs . when i finish cleaning the floor all of the grout lines are consistently damp which shows they have been scrubbed . i 'm satisfied . hope this helps . judy 
a water solution with brushes that can get into the cracks and crevices in my floor like nothing i 've tried before . i am very glad that i bought it ! 
i use it on laminate . there is a hard brush head and a soft brush head . just use the soft one on the laminate . i use the hard one on a tile stone bathroom floor . love it 
it cleans the grout , but you still have to manually get on your hands and knees to clean the grout really well with a toothbrush or similar tool for really dirty grout . 
the hoover floormate works well on my indoor tiles and grout , which do n't get very dirty . it does n't work that well on my outdoor tile and grout which gets especially moldy here on the rainy side of the big island . i had to scrub my outdoor tile ( which does n't have a smooth surface , but grooves and indentations ) and grout with bon ami , and then the floormate was a big help ( i just filled the container with water - no soap ) in rinsing and picking up the dirt mold that i dislodged with my bon ami and elbow grease-powered scrub brush . 
the papers that came with box spring did not really have that info . what they did have was a manufacturer and a phone number ... .leggett & platt . then they have warranty info number of 800-888-3078. hope this helps . this box is easy to set up , very sturdy and well made . 
do n't bet on it being delivered at all . i ordered mine 6 days ago , and they just got around to telling me tonight that they were cancelling the order . supposedly was supposed to be delivered this week , or so they originally told me . very professional . 
this is n't exactly the same thing but sort of ... our toddler loves jumping on the bed and mattress springs and we have never heard any squeaking . i mean different weight and motion but sim ? 
this box foundation does come in queen size . however , it is not a mattress , it is just the foundation that you would place your mattress on top of . 
they are large - 25 '' x 15 '' , with a loop in one corner for easy hanging drying . 
these are a large 25 '' x 15 '' , with a small loop in one corner for easy hanging and drying . 
they did n't shrink too much when i washed them , before i embroidered them . i do plan on ordering more . 
hello ! at this moment we do not . we do have single color 6 packs of just red , green or blue if you 'd like to get a specific color vs a multiple color pack ! you can see them here http : www.amazon.com kitchen-towels-vintage-absorbent-natural dp b00jql8wcc ref=sr_1_4 ? s=home-garden & ie=utf8 & qid=1431619769 & sr=1-4 & keywords=kitchen+towels 
i do n't really think it matters . i 've used regular tide liquid detergent , tide pods and gain flings . all did a great job at removing stains ( although i think i prefer tide pods ) . hope this helps ! 
no 
i have done a lot of research into that , they are made by a company called aunt martha 's although they all come with a tag 100 % cotton , made in india . now i am not sure if the cotton is grown and milled there or if they actually make the towels . they are well made and very durable when used and washed . i myself have been trying to find where i can get them wholesale rather than retail , cost is killing me , lots of work and little profit embroidering them . but have n't had any luck finding anyone but amazon who sells them cheep enough . there is another company that sells wholesale towels called hoffmen but they sell only terry cloth and the few that are not are linen only . 
they are true to the advertised dimension . thank you 
it is ivory and a very soft salmon color . not gray or brown at all 
yes 
no , it ca n't be flipped over . 
if it 's one of these beds you can set up in different positions , like rise your legs and or the upper part of the body , no . it will not work 
it is `` rolled and compressed '' for shipping convenience . it is much easier to ship small things in size than it is to ship big things . about 24-48 hours . 
no discernible difference - it just sleeps very comfortably ! 
the instructions said to allow 48 hours but as soon as i unrolled it and gave it like 10 minutes , it was already 9 inches high . i left it for about 36 hours and it was great after that . 
yes . the bottom is enameled as well and is smooth . so it should be fine on a glass top . i believe it 's fine for induction tops too . 
yes 
mine came as blue . didnt even realize description was different . 
maryann , made a stew that had some tomato in it but just a small amount . no staining from that . i baked a bread in it at 425 degrees and had some very faint browning in the enamel but not much . 
yes it is assembled in china 
not sure . we have n't tried it . 
i bought a separate bed skirt for the set . it does n't cover all the way past box springs . 
it is just a comforter , 2 pillow shams or cases whatever u call them and one throe pillow ! no sheets at all ! 
full size washer or extra large washer . 
hello . it is made of engineered wood with a scratch and stain resistant laminate finish . 
25 inches . it 's a good table for the price . easy build for a handy person . it 's not solid oak , so go easy tightening screws . i like it . 
no it ca n't . the box is also very heavy but well worth it . 
i was surprised that the storage was smaller than i expected but turns out it is perfect for magazines , remotes etc . it is 5 '' deep - full inside demensions are 5 '' x 15.5 '' x 37 '' . i work from home a lot so i store my computer cables , mouse and such in it . still love it ! 
it looks like this : http : www.sauder.com stylelab finishzoom.aspx ? finishid=221 
it 's exactly 24 '' - i am able to sit on the couch and use my computer very comfortably with it . i love it ! 
wonder have black on it ? i would like black one if not tht okay 
yes there are . please see these : http : www.amazon.com gp product b0081llb9e or http : www.amazon.com sauder-carson-washington-cherry-finish dp b00bmc54i8 ref=sr_1_1 ? m=a3qnpqsxeeah4p & s=merchant-items & ie=utf8 & qid=1391381967 & sr=1-1 & keywords=b00bmc54i8 
i have both a grill pan and have used this ringer on it . i have found it easier to just use your finger on a single layer of the ringer between the bars than trying to ball it up and scrub . although you can do that too . i ca n't comment on the finer mesh as i do n't own one . 
they must be welded although i ca n't see any weld marks because you can not pull it apart . do n't know for sure but this little piece of mesh is a wonder . kind of pricey , i thought , but sure glad i cracked and bought it because it does the trick . 
it 's been working great on mine . i 've been using it on my cast , stainless and even my high carbon steel flat bottom wok ( helped clean the ridges where food would stick ) all with great results 
as far as i can tell it should work well with any type of cast iron cooking grate . you bunch it up in your hand and use it like a scouring pad . since it is meant to be used on all cast iron cookware it should work well . the only caveat is that it does not cover a large area like a grill so you would have to do an area at a time . 
beautifully and very easy 
it works great . i use it on my stainless steel ( and even pyrex occasionally ) , in addition to my cast iron . just fyi ... it has done a remarkable job on my cast iron wok , getting rid of the gritty stuff and leaving it with a lovely seasoned finish . 
hello kellie ! they are a standard 8 oz jar , however they will hold 10 -12 oz of liquid easily . ( at the bottom of the threads . ) thanks for asking . you can use the lids again on any size standard mason jar . 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 24 and 32 oz . : ) 
hi ! the jars are definitely dishwasher safe . i would be careful with the lids . i 've had them for almost 3 months and decided to wash them by hand and let them air dry . i have noticed small sections that started to rust . my recommendation would be to wash the lids by hand and dry them immediately . the jars are super cute though and a hit with our children guests . 
sure thing rhonda ! 12 jars , 12 lids , and 14-16 straws ! thanks for asking ! 
hello ! 12 jars , 12 lids , and 14-16 straws ! thanks so much for asking ! 
they are fixed with dowels and screws and ore drilled for placement . can not be moved . 
the bottom part is . however , the back of the hutch has the screw heads exposed and just a light coat of paint . kind of roughly finished . 
yes it 's borderless . got it for my daughter , it 's perfect . 
no it is n't 
dear sachi , standard ( free ) shipping takes from 10 to 15 working days . however , you can also choose expedited shipping for $ 34.95. it takes from 2-3 business days . maybe , this is an option for you . kind regards , customer service team poster outlet 
dear alexis , at the moment , we do n't have this item on stock . we had to reorder it . that is why it takes so long to ship it . kind regards , customer service team poster outlet 
the external one has no drain holes , it holds the water . if you want to separate the greens from the water , you have to use both bowls toghether . you can use them toghether normally , not only when you want to dry the salad , but also to keep the salad for some days . 
the company states that it `` makes a conscious effort to avoid using bpas in their products . '' they do not state bpa free . 
large bowl is 5.5 qts , large colander is 5 qts , medium bowl & colander are both 3 qts , small bowl is 1.5 qts , and the small colander is 1 qt . 
the plastic is tough and solid . the white color outside is shiny , the bottom is covered with rubber ( stays in one place while you 're mixing ) and each bowl comes with a solid plastic strainer that fits perfectly within each bowl and better yet each bowl has a cover for left overs . if that 's not enough , everything fits together and all is dishwasher safe . i would strongly recommend this purchase . 
i have used one in them a couple of times and it does n't seem to damage it . 
no , they are not . the bottom of the bowl says not to put them in the microwave . but i do like them as mixing bowls -- and they are slip-resistant . 
correct . it is foam all the way through and as such , is easier for them to ship . the package is like a really long document package so outside of length is easy to move around a house . 
well it 's just like sleeping on a regular mattress ... . once it expands , it stays that way ( like a regular , normal mattress ) . it 's just the way it 's packed for shipment that makes u wonder how it 's a matress ... 
i think it would be too thin and uncomfortable . i have it on a bed frame and i had to buy a 2 inch mattress topper for it and it 's okay now . 
no . just mattress 
our came airtight white plastic 
no 
outside- 11 3 4 '' deep , 10 '' tall and 17.5 '' wide . inside is 10 '' deep , 7.5 '' tall and 11 3 4 wide . i ca n't fit a tall mug in there . i can just barely fit a standard plate in there . be warned the glass plate inside does not fit on the rail correctly and is constantly coming off and clanking around . 
no . it has a three prong plug . 
yes their are on the left side . enjoy hadey mae on facebook madeas lost sister . thanks for the question . 
3 then 4 when opening door 
there is a timer which is audible when the food is done . 
yes 
yes you can use it outdoors . right now i have it in a fountain out side on my patio and works fine . 
about 24 inches ... .i sometimes sit in a folding chair if i 'm forced into ironing ! 
not without a saw 
it is made of a metal so thin and weak that it is almost transparent . by all that is good and holy , please , i implore you , do not throw away your money on this flimsy waste of space . 
not very thick but it works ! ! ! i really am pleased with this smaller version as i did n't want a regular size ironing board ! ! ! ! 
actual length of board . ..36 1 2 inches..plus 7 inch iron rest..great ironing board..very easy to get ..easy storing..does n't take space ironing board is 36 1 2 inches long..plus..attached iron rest ... 7 inches . a great board . easy to get up..and down..easy storage..until one has to do more ironing . who likes to that ! ! 
it does not . it is welded , it 's a continuation of the board itself . the only dynamic parts are the legs . 
yes . i treat it like any laundry of similar color . it does n't lose shape or shrink . 
the size is incorrect for usa . but if you put it on your bed with the tag hanging from side ways it fits perfect . that is what i do on my bed that is a queen , but bought the kibg . it is very nice 
it came with king shams and i am not at our house where it is so i ca n't give you the dimensions . 
i think it will shred it but not make long strips . 
pretty much just shreds ... makes great veggie noodles ! 
no . 
it is a strip slicer so cuts things into julienne strips , so with an onion it will act more like a grater than a slicer . i use it to grate zucchini and onions for my quinoa turkey meatballs recipe . and to julienne vegetables like carrots , zucchini , beets , cucumber , for salads etc 
i 'm not sure how it would affect the canvas but i think it might cause the wood frame to warp . 
it 's not the actual size . not sure about the availability . 
the insert is metal . and , why would there be a need to microwave , since you can plug it in ? 
no 
i do n't know the temp , but it gets refrigerator cold food , hot in time for lunch . 
there is no coating . it is high polished surgical stainless steel quality . other presses with coatings and plastic parts are difficult to keep clean because of the lemon oils that tend to build up on them easily . this press is by far the best i 've owned . very efficient press and very easy to keep clean . i 've had no problem with oil build up . i use mine daily . 
it 's 9 inches from tip to tip , the bowl is about 3 inches , the handles about 5 inches , with about one inch for the hinge . 
the inside diameter of the bowl part is 2 inches 7 8. just a little bit under 3 inches . 
none at all ! 
china 
the juice press is sturdy and i ca n't imagine the handles bending unless someone attempts to juice the lemon lime whole versus cutting it in half first . 
do n't know . not stamped on juicer 
i have n't looked for one , but i do use a travel pillowcase over this pillow to help keep it clean . i change it when i change my other pillowcases . 
a very pretty blue 
this pillow is approximately 16 '' x 12 '' x 4 '' 
this pillow weighs approximately 2.5 lbs . 
it 's a wicked , cool mist diffuser 
yes you can ! it works ! i love mine . 
yes . mine is connected to my computer all day 
3-3 4 `` , but there is a 3 4 '' lip on the bottom of each shelf to keep the polish from falling . 
it 's 24 '' long tall and about 19.5 '' -20 '' wide . 
i 'm not sure of the dimensions of mini liquid bottles . if they are as big as a regular size bottle of polish they should work just fine . the shelf polish rack is very thick plastic , very sturdy so it will handle the weight . 
they would not fall out but they might fall over if knocked or tiped 
the racks are open from end to end . 
12 ounces 
i only ordered the 16 piece sets but when i searched , there were no other pieces available . 
yes . i just looked at the bottom of one of the plates and it does say made in china . however , they are very nice . 
eleven inches 
my set of these dishes was made in china . i do n't know if the pfaltzgraff company is german or not , but i have old pfaltzgraff that was made in the usa . 
my dinner plates are 11 inches . 
the cutting blades are made of 420j2 stainless steel , which is a highly corrosion resistant steel . this material is highly resistant to food acids , detergents , etc . the can opener is guaranteed not to rust , ever 
no , its made in china by a very reputable company that produces quality products . its a very nice can opener . 
in my experience all can openers last much longer if they are washed by hand but since this is all stainless steel construction you probably can use the dishwasher . 
i do n't know what a # 10 can is , but i 've opened every size can that i 've bought from the supermarket . i 've never had a problem opening any cans . this is the best hand can opener i 've ever had , and i 've had almost every one on the market . i think you 'd be happy with this opener , and i 'm sure it would open a # 10 can . 
it can be used by both left handed people & right handed people . 
bought this for my hurricane survival kit and thankfully have n't had to use it yet , but in the name of science i 'll use it today and report back . 
it is extremely comfortable , very thick . i told my mother about this since she needs a new mattress and box spring and she is going to order this one that i have . i told her about the free shipping and she really liked that 
the mattress is about 10 '' and the box is about 8 '' so you should get about 18 '' together 
yes , it comes with both 
its about 10 '' 
i see its available now 
i just set my old mattress by the curb on garbage day and someone picked it up ! 
i run my units 24 hours day , this way it 's easier for them to keep up with the introduction of new allergens pathogens into the air . 
you can purchase them at www.airocide.com for 99.99 
yes , it works with 220v . 
hi bruce , it 's super-easy , definitely easier than changing a printer toner cartridge . it takes less than 30 seconds to do , and there 's zero mess to deal with . 
yes ... ebags slim lunchboxs work great.. ( you can get them on amazon : ) you have room for the lunchblox and a thermos ... : ) hope that helps ! 
yes , but nothing else ( like a juice box or water bottle ) will . the dimensions are 9x7x3 . 
no , not any of the ones we have . 
they are leak proof . a preschooler might have a little difficulty opening ... 
i 'm not familiar with the wildkin bag , but here are the dimensions of the boxes : large container ( 5.5x 5x 2.25 in ) and the 2 smaller containers ( 5x3x2.25 in ) 
we have used it for 6 months and have never had any odors or different taste to our food 
absolutely ! serated knives are my favorite as they are more versatile . i honestly did n't think you could sharpen a serated edge until i gave it a try with my perfect edge sharpener , it worked ! i would definitely recommend this sharpener for serated edges , you will be glad you did ! 
no i am sorry it can not . 
yes i bought it for the size so i can make enough for me and my children and one time . but i have used it just for myself with no problems . 
yes this has floating hinges.inch and a half-2inches high . 
yup ! a lil smashef , but delicious ! 
yes you can grill any kind of vegetables zucchini , give them a little bit salt and pepper will be perfect 
no , it does not , but you can simply stagger when you put certain foods on the grill in relation to one another . works fine for me grilling meat and veggies . 
16 1 2 '' x 9 '' one large plate . 
2 feet 
110 ! 
no they do not 
never counted them but it looks like 500 
if i had to guess i would say about 5 cups of pop corn give or take a cup . 
made in the u.s.a. as written on the bottom of the bag . 
at least 4 
yes this is a mattress and box thanks 
yes it 's a mattress and box spring set . they delivered both inside one large box . 
it can be flipped . 
yes , no problem . ample fabric to cover modern , thick mattresses . nice quality too 
no , i purchased one . 
these are microfiber sheets . so i do n't think there is a thread count . 
200 square feet sounds very large too me for what this will do . i will say it is rewarding to empty it each day , but it only holds maybe a cup or two of water ... .it makes a dent in my 100 square foot bathroom but 200 sounds pretty big ... 
absolutely not , you need a bigger machine to do this . 
i think only the color . it 's quiet , and even though it 's small it has made a noticeable difference in the air quality . i have it in my basement and the dank odor is gone . works great . 
this little dehumidifier is great for dehumidifying damp rooms but i believe this will not work like an exhaust fan for bathrooms . sorry if this is not what you want to hear but it sounds like you would need someone to install an exhaust fan for your bathroom . good luck ! 
not sure if voltage is adjustable . 
i have not tried the hard candy yet . i have assembled the two halves , piped chocolate into the hole for the stick and then inserted the stick . 
3 to 4 
yes 
hi regina , thank you for your inquiry ! seat size : 20.5 '' w x 20 '' d back size : 24 '' w x 27 '' h seat height : 18.5 '' h arm height from floor : 23 '' h arm height from seat : 7.5 '' h overall width : 29 '' w overall depth : 33.5 - 45 '' d overall height : 40 '' h weight capacity : 250 lbs . bisonoffice 
yes , there is a knob on the side the tighten the back reclining feature . 
no the ottoman is a fixed height matching that of the chair . 
the chair is exceptionally stable . my 83 year old mother in law sits in it all day without a problem . the bottom base is very wide . 
no , it does not . 
no 
no the height can not be changed . 
there are a few different colors in leather . item numbers : bt-7862-bk-gg bt-7862-bn-gg bt-7862-burg-gg bt-7862-cream-gg 
i do n't really know but what i know for sure is that it can hold at least 300lbs . 
this scale comes precalibrated with a readability of 1 gram and a weight capacity of 11 lbs . 5 kg . 
it uses lithium battery 3v cr2032 . they 're not expensive . http : www.walmart.com ip insten-5pcs-cr-2032-cr2032-3v-lithium-button-cell-coin-battery 31515503 
no , the minimum is 1 gram . 
made in china 
it 's an auto shut off ; however , i 've always had time to add or remove something . it does n't shut off rapidly , but it comes back on instantly when you touch the power bar . i like this product a lot . 
no it does not . i would not recommend buying this one . i 'm not impressed . for the money . 
no it does not . 
no . the weight is only there while the product is on . 
no , just any support will do . slats on a frame , closely spaced , or , just any type of solid support . 
i was suprised when it was delivered ~ the mattress comes in a box about the size of a 42 '' tv . maybe a bit long . very easy and lite to handle ! 
yes you could put this on your floor . i did that with a similar mattress for years . i have it on a platform bed frame which it really just a lifted floor . 
no 
there is a cover on the mattress , but it would be difficult to remove and wash and put back on . personally i have put a nice pillow top type of mattress pad on mine so it feels extra luxurious plus i can remove it and wash it . 
i 'm not sure why not -- most any solid flat surface should be ok. of course , if the surface it 's on flexes or dips it may have some effect on how the mattress feels and responds to pressure , but i would n't think it would necessarily be a `` bad '' thing to do . 
queen size 
got out my tape measure out for this one . height : 8-8.5 inches length : 78 inches width : 59 inches 
120 volts . not good for wide bottom mugs . multi- purpose . also melts wax . i warmed a muffin and breakfast roll . 
yes , tehy work fine and it 's not too hot to touch the plastic sides . great warmer . 
it has 18 watts 
it has an on off slide type button on the cord , but it has no light to let you know if it is on or off . it gets very hot , and i burned my finger when i first tried it as it was on when i took it out of the box . i plugged it in and read the directions and when i went to pick it up my finger hit the hot part `` ouch '' when i turn it on i usually have to click more than once for it to come on , i have to wait a minute and put a drop of water on it to see if it is hot , it it 's not i click again and do the same thing , i have found that if i click it twice it usually comes on . i would not recommend this one . before i bought it i asked a ? to see if it had rubber feet on the bottom , and someone answered that it did ... it does not ! i have found that a lot of times there are reviews for several different models by the same company in the same comment section , so it 's best to type the exact name of the product and any other info needed to recognize it so if someone answers a question it is for your model . 
i have no idea how hot it gets , i just know it keeps my coffee mug nice and hot & # 128522 ; . sorry i could n't be of more help ruth 
it 's about 3 1 2 inches in diameter . we never had a problem with larger mugs . 
works fine for a tumbler , not too hot . 
it has an off and on button 
3 4 '' round by just about 1 4 '' thick . 
i have been using mine for 8 years with no problems 
nope ! they are clean and paint dye free . 
no glue is required for these , but when they break , its like gun powder all over the place . the little ones like this hold up better . 
this is a more complicated question than you might think . the power of the magnet is n't the only determining factor . other things to consider are the type of metal you 're planning to use it on ( stainless vs. regular steel ) , the thickness of the paint ( if any ) , and what are you trying to support ( paper , plastic clips , etc . ) . using a single disc i was able to hold 20 standard ( 20 lb . ) sheets of paper on a smooth steel cabinet with thin paint , 18 on a smooth steel door with thick paint , and 15 on a textured refrigerator with standard paint . i also used card stock ( 80 lb . ) sheets and got up to 9 , 8 , and 7 sheets respectively . when i opened the doors most of them fell , but that was because the sheets did n't stick to each other very well . if i had glued the magnet to a clip and used the clip to hold the paper , it likely would hold more weight since it would be in more direct contact with the metal - but it would also depend on how far out the clip stood because of leverage . i estimate that these magnets are 1.5 to 2 times as strong as typical refrigerator magnets that you buy at large retailers . 
since `` north '' and `` south '' are really artificial constructs for a magnet 's inherent polarity , it really does n't matter . if you want to use them for teaching kids they can mark them and figure it out . if you just want to hot glue them into bottle caps for the refrigerator door , that wo n't matter . 
i bought it as a gift so i can not tell you . i am sorry 
the letters are plastic . 
2 weeks 
no there was no recipe . let me know if you need anything else . 
yes , they are made of plastic . i have n't tried them out yet , but they seem solid ! 
about 3 inches 
rpd-702wp can be continuously operated with 3 drainage options ; manual drain , gravity drain and condensate pump drain . the condensate pump can pump out ( and up ) condensation water through the included 16.5 ' drain for continuous water removal with approximately 15 ' of vertical lift . 
it takes heat to pull the moinsture from the air-so yes it puts heat out . but overall the room feels cooler because you are n't dealing with high humidity . when i first started my unit the humidity in the house was 91 percent . i have kept the humidity down to between 35-40 for several months , usually removing about 5 gallons of water a day ( empty cannister morning and night ) . i am from high mountain desert and humidity very low -- so the seattle humidity was killing me and my mold mildew allergies . no problems now with either and my home is comfortable . the little heat is worth all the other benefitis . i keep my unit downstairs and it keeps all 3500 sq ft nice and dry . had this for 8 months and would buy it again . 
no . not really . there is a plastic piece of unit that is about an eighth of an inch above the casters so you would gain a negligible amount of space even if caster did come off which i 'm not 100 % sure they do . i saw there was no gain so i did not investigate further . hope that helps . 
three choices : 3feet plastic 1 2 '' 16 feet plastic 5 16 '' for condensation pump option hose bib - user supplied hose 
yes ... that is what i am using it for currently basement . i went with this size because the smaller 30 pint was to much work for the unit . plus i did n't want to empty the bucket a million times a day 
roughly 65 inches by 30 inches . 
i have the red white and blue one and i love it ! has a creamy kind of white tho 
i sent as a gift , i can not answer the question . 
36 inches x 15.5 inches x 36 inches ; 57 pounds 
mdf ( medium-density fibreboard ) 
my tv is a 42 '' and it is flush with either side . your pedestal would probably fit fine but you 'd have nearly 5 '' on either side , so stability might be an issue . 
yes enough room for , tv and vcr 
i do n't see why not other than having holes where the hinges would be . but why buy this lovely piece when you can find others that do not have the doors 
34 w x 14.5 d x 36 h. the table top is slightly larger measuring 36 x 15.5 . 
yes . 
1 1 4 '' inside height , 1 3 8 '' outside height 
sorry , i do n't know the answer to this question . i gave the pan as a gift . the recipient has used it on gas , electric & ceramic but do n't know about induction . 
mine were sent in shrink wrapped bundles of 10 . 
for shirts yes , for pants , coats not at all . if you need it for pants get the metal . but works great for shirts and light stuff 
i dont think so . we have n't tried anyhow . 
this waffle maker the voltage is 120v 
no . 
6 '' by 6 '' inches 
yep 
yes and they 're good chairs 
i 'm not sure if nesting is on top one on another . for that answer is no . they close and if all face the same side they fit well but not necessarily `` nesting '' just neatly put away 
16 ' off the ground 
it 's 14 1 2 '' from the ground to the bottom of seat . 
yes they do 
its a 12 inch mattress , i think the topper is 2.5inch . its a nice mattress for the price .

hi , thanks for your question . according to the product title , this listing is for the memory foam mattress only . the bed frame in the picture is only for visual purposes . thanks for your interest ! 
i 'm not sure if you 're asking about a specific quantified number or not . but this mattress tends to be on the firm side . it gives and cradles where it needs to , but it 's not a `` soft and sink '' feeling at all . i 've had mine for a year now , and i love mine ! 
good morning , dz . thank you for your inquiry to plow & hearth . the table meaures 14 '' l x 42 '' w x 30 '' h. i hope this information is helpful . please let me know if i can be of further assistance . sincerley , sarah-plow & hearth customer service 
hi carol , this item is 14 '' deep . i hope this information is helpful . - crystal , plow & hearth customer service 
dear john , thank you for your inquiry to plow & hearth . the only color available is walnut . i hope this has been helpful . please let me know if i can be of further assistance . sincerely , sarah w. plow & hearth customer service 
yes , i 've had cheese melt and burn on it from a grilled cheese sandwich , wiped off with a paper towel . looked like i had n't used the pan at all ! 
it should not warp . mine has never warped . 
i have bought the contemporary before in a double griddle which i 've had for years and still is good and i had no problem with this one i really like it 
i have a gas stove . but it heats pretty evenly on mine . good griddle pan . just do n't use high heat on it . not necessary . 
absolutely not ! ! you never use metal utensils on non-stick cookware . 
no . it does not . 
i really like this pan . i have a large burner on an electric cooktop , so it seems to heat evenly . do n't know how well it would do on a small burner . 
that i do n't know but i will share with you that it warped almost immediately . i still use it , but not as impressed as i had hoped to be . also- can not use areosol sprays such as pam , ( even the olive oil one ) which is a disappointment 
go to octorose.com ... .they have the curtains that match this spread . 
yes just like in the picture . pillow shams 
we have one set for the bed -- excellent . if you have a queen , order a king size so it reaches the ground . 
i 'm sorry but we do not offer the matching curtains and not aware where they are sold . we apologize for inconvenience . 
you should say are there pillows . there are pillow shams and you use your own pillows . 
david , thank you for your inquiry . the is just the quilted cover and 2 shams . depending on the depth of your bed and or box spring dimensions , it 's hard to say if this will drape all the way to the floor . the queen size is 90 '' x 90 '' , and the king is 94 '' x 102 '' . so best advice would be to measure this out and see what will suit your needs best . if you have any other questions i would be more than happy to answer them . 
thr curtains is 2panels each is 60x84 .. 
sofa 
def more tan . 
this is only a sofa . love seat size . there is no mattress . 
it 's a lighter color but really nice 
the sofa is 73 '' long . the problem o have is the width from back to front . in other words the cushions you sit on are not wide . when you lay on it you feel like you 're going to fall off . a queen size mattress is 60 '' wide if that 's any help . not sure what you mean 
yeah its got the little twist thing at the handle i think , but thats the only way . it may still be too much suction , its got lots of power ! 
no , no beater brush . i do not reccomend this vaccum cleaner as the components are very cheap and it does not perform well at all . 
as i understand you can wash and dry the ones that came with it , chris 
hi , yes it has a two seperate pieces . one is a small brush the other is for small spaces . 
i would call them winter white , not bright white . certainly not cream . they are very nice . 
yes 
yes it does . 
the legs are dark brown , like espresso . 
counter height i believe 60. do n't get bad quality 
mine do n't get a lot of use , but they 're holding up perfectly . 
cream colored 
i measured about 3.75 fluid ounces for each one . i 'd plan for 3.5 , so with 6 ice pops , that will make 21 ounces . 
these ice pop molds can withstand temperatures up to 450 f because they are fda approved silicone material . they should not touch an open flame or burner though . 
yes , i always freeze them on their sides . 
i received an email that gave me the link to the e-book . 
it says made in china on the box . all 100 % silicone products do not have bpa . you can only find bpa in plastics . bpa is a chemical they put into plastics when trying to make it soft ( e.g . baby bottle nipple ) . silicone is naturally flexible , so it does not need it . that 's why silicone is so popular . 
eh it kind of works but it does not work nearly as well as regular potatoes . i tried a snickers bar once too when i was drunk baked . i wouldnt reccomend it . 
just cut them in 4ths if you have to man 
no . it has two size blades but not one skinny enough for me to call shoestring 
no 
about 3 8 '' 
yes 
yes 
yes 
yes 
yes , use the custom cake link please 
it should accept most plastic and stainless straws , and some smaller diameter glass straws ! 
no , as long as you keep it upright . the hole at the top does n't have a closure . 
# 5 
one ! it 's awesome . 
unfortunately it does n't display the dimension . i 'm certain the wide mouth lid will not fit on a regular sized mason jar . see regular sized cuppow lids cuppow.com 
no it looks just like that ! u do need large pillows to slide in cases tho 
i 'm not sure if you can order drapes that match seperatly . they are not included in the set that i received . 
i 'm unsure of what material is it is filled with . it felt paper like to me so i sent it back . 
2 shams are included . also included are 3 decorative pillows , a bed-skirt and the comforter . 
i would say vintage matt and a sort of antique feel to it . it does n't look shiny like new . the colors are a little muted..in the best way : ) 
wood ... i believe it is a wood composite . 
we 've been using them for only about a month , but several times a week , going through the dishwasher each time , and i have n't noticed any difference at this point . i 've even packed yogurt and chocolate pudding in the smaller partition with the help of a little stick n seal wrap and it has n't leaked . 
the lid is marked # 5 - pp . hope that helps ! 
yes ! an applesauce cup does fit in it . i 've personally put them in it . it fits and closes just fine . no need to pour the applesauce into the container . 
a qualified yes . i have some standard short insulated zip-around that fit them perfectly . a tiny bit of head room for a thin ice pack and juice pouch ( probably not a juice box ) . the taller , boxy insulated zip-arounds have a smaller footprint and do n't fit them . the fold-down insulated bags are too small . i just bought an ebags lunchbox to accommodate more variety of drink options ( like a water bottle ) . 
8 1 2 x 5 1 2 x 1 1 2 
yup ! definitely . these are great . i personally use one or two to bring to work and one at home for my son 's food . i think it 's a bit large for a toddler or preschooler really as the compartments are deep , but it 's easy to store leftovers since you can just cover and pop it back in the fridge . it 's perfect for a salad or bunch of fruit in the large compartment , a very good size portion of cottage cheese in the second largest cup ( full cup at least probably but i have never actually measured ) and then some salad dressing in the smallest cup ( which only uses about 1 6 of the space ) . a sandwich would fit perfectly i think . 
yes 
sorry i have n't tested it underwater ... . 
it can fit the 5s , or 5 . 
yes 
no 
no timer 10h auto shut off 
it plugs into a 110 outlet 
has n't harmed mine . they get washed at least every month while in use . 
yes 
80 x 80 
hi james ! thank you for your inquiry ! seat size : 13.25 '' w x 16.5 '' d back size : 14 '' w x 18.75 '' h seat height : 19 '' h arm height from floor : 26.5 '' h arm height from seat : 8 '' h overall width : 21.125 '' w overall depth : 23 '' d overall height : 36.5 '' h weight capacity : 400 lbs . aiste bisonoffice 
completely crystal clear . beautiful clarity . no grey undertones . 
about 27 ounces . 
yes . 
its not too big , probably about the diameter of a quarter . 
of course , providing the recipe specifies pounds or ounces or grams ... 
the weight number does n't lock ; you can add & subtract food items and the total will adjust . be aware that the weight displays in kg you 'll have to convert to lbs . if that 's what you 're looking for . hope that helps . 
approx . 71 2 x21 2 '' 
i sleep very comfortable . it keeps you warm , not sweaty or hot . 
i guess somewhere around 20 lbs . i had no problem carrying the box upstairs to the bedroom other than it was bulky . hope this helps you . 
standard sheets should fit on this mattress given this topper is only 3 '' it will depend how thick your existing mattress is . 
no this is the best crock pot i have ever owned ... .quality ... .i am going to get another one ... 
yes if you want to take out the center and put it on the table..i love this crock it is the best one i have . i love that it locks so it is easy to transfer place to place if you have to . 
this is our only istir slow cooker currently available . the stir attachment is suitable for use with slow cooker models sccpvc650as-x , sccpvc600as-x , sccpvp650as-x or sccpvp600as-x . 
yes , two latches that hook over the rim of the ceramic pot insert . 
yes , this unit will automatically switch to warm after the cooking cycle is finished . 
mine does n't have anything like that . 
i assume it has something to do with the sensor , since i did n't have it in my other oven 
so far it is holding up well , but we only put it together 4-days ago . it took around 2-hours to build and the quality was better than i expected . not a bad deal for the money . 
my daughters ceiling is 8ft and i would think you would want to be at that height at the minimum . 
about 4 feet 
they are fixed . 
my husband says yes . i know you can turn the pullout keyboard part of the desk to pull towards the outside of the bed instead of towards the inside under the bed . 
a twin mattress should fit fine . nothing bigger than a twin would fit . 
there are six different height adjustments . 
20.5 '' x 16.5 `` 
i 'd say the top is plastic and it weighs maybe 8 ounces . the top can fold down but that 's it . 
no . the table 's top is not adjustable in that way . there is a slight tilt to it , but one can not adjust it . you can adjust height of the table . 
it does slant forward indeed . there is n't adjustments , but i 'm sure you can find a way to somewhat force it . it 's now a big problem for me . 
placed in the lowest position , the table is 21 '' high in the back and 22 '' high in the front . the front of my table is an inch higher than at the back , perhaps to compensate for something heaving being placed at the front ? at its highest setting , the table is approximately 28 and 1 2 '' high in the back and approximately 29 and 1 2 '' high in the front . there are four other height settings between the highest and lowest settings and each are 2 '' apart . maggie 
yes it can be removed , very handi 
it wo n't adjust at all . it barely assembles . total piece of garbage . do not purchase ! 
yes , it has 6 adjustment levels about 1.5 inch apart . 
i 'm not sure about the pan ( i only bought the 2 pack silicone mats ) , but from research it seems that the company has a us address but the mats , at least , are manufactured in china . their website is n't very clear but maybe you can call them for more info . hope this helps . 
yes 
i do n't have anything to measure mm right now but i placed old cutter on top of new blades and they are exactly the same size . these fit my grinder attachment and work very well for me . i am very pleased with these replacement blades . 
they are too small for a size # 8 meat grinder . to double check , your round meat grinder plates should be about 2 1 18 '' diameter . they they will work . if your plates are 2 3 8 '' which is a standard size # 8 then you need to buy the size # 8 blade . thanks from smokehousechef.com

yes it is all stainless steelq 
i 'll do my best to answer this qustion . the inside diameter of the steamer basket is 9.5 inches at its ' widest point and 4 1 8th inches deep . the pot depth is 5 7 8 inches . when inserted , the steamer basked goes into the pot approximately 1 3 4 inches . i use this steamer regularly . in fact , i used it today to par-steam two pounds of brussels sprouts for freezing . i could not be happier with the product . it gets a great deal of use in my kitchen . 
this is made in china . 
metal and it seals well 
works beautifully on my induction ! 
perforations are on the bottom as well as the sides . i love this steamer . i use it more than any other pan well worth the money ! 
hi - we are in the final stages of production and should be back in stock by the 2nd or 3rd week of june . thank you for your interest in d. charles luxury microfiber sheets . -- little halo merchant team 
hi deepti r - the dimensions for the queen sets are as follows : - deeper 14 '' pockets which fit up to a 17 '' mattress . - flat sheet 102 x 88 '' fitted : 60 x 80 '' pillowcases : 20 x 30 '' we hope this is the information you are looking for . if you have any other questions , please let us know . -- little halo merchant team 
disappointingly this machine does not clean grout . the mcculloch mc-1275 heavy-duty steam cleaner , also available on amazon , does a great job . 
they sent me a `` refurbished '' machine originally , when i complained they sent a second one . the trigger for the steam blast broke on the first use , so now it super steams all the time . they both still work after a few weeks , but they are cheap-ish and your expectations should be low-ish . ok , i guess . 
yes , i use it on my pergo laminate floors and it works great 
we have not attempted to use the unit on carpet of any kind . we bought it for cleaning tile floors and ca n't say that we have been impressed with the results . the white grout still looks dark gray . so it is in a closet for lack of a better use . 
i 've not tried it on granite , but since it wo n't sit in one spot producing steam . ( handle upright position great design ) i would try it as and use it like a mop , the steam it produces heats to 213 degrees . it works great . use distilled water . 
yes . i have a twin over full bunk bed and it fit standard size . 
it could . just make sure you get the appropriate size for your day bed 
the directions suggest at least 24 hours . 
39x75inches ( twin size ) 
it 's a pillow top mattress ... so not flipped but can be rotated . 
no 
not sure but have had a 300 lbs person sleep on it all night and its still 9 inches high without even a dent 
this mattress is all foam so it will bend with an adjustable mattress . 
yes i sometimes sleep on my side , or my stomuch , it 's great anyway i sleep . i feel great in the morning & # 128512 ; 
up to 3 '' .. standard dorm bed post size 
no . not recommended . designed to work with legs of a stand , box spring would slide . very unsafe . 
about seven inches by seven inches 
the top opening is a 2 & 5 8 inch square opening with rounded corners . almost 3 4 inches deep recess . 
a normal sized drinking straw will fit . the opening does not look big enough for an over-sized straw . i used paper straws when i used them for a party . plastic straws should fit as well . 
metal . they were of excellent quality . i ended up buying 100+ to use at my wedding . 
wide mouth jar lids have a bigger diameter so no , i do n't think they will fit . these lids are designed for the regular tapered canning jars . measurements are available on various web sites that sell canning jars , like walmart and k-mart . 
it fit mine but was disappointed inthe lid as straw will not fit in middle hole 
yes , i think so . 
these lids are designed to fit any size jar as long as it is regular and not wide mouth . hope this helps ! 
smaller than boba , larger than taco bell . i found lots of straws online and they all seemed to be standard sized . whatever they sent me was just perfect ! they can also use standard grocery store straws . enjoy ! 
it is all in one , just a normal lid . so no other parts are needed . hope this helps . 
yes , that is the measurement . they fit on a surprising number of things . 
i would think that stainless steel straws can be used with the lids . depending on the size of the straws , you may have to put them through one of the `` petal '' sections rather than the middle circle . i used paper straws and fitting them into the middle was difficult but i think using them in the petals is better since that way the straws are slanted and easier to drink from . 
no hanging loop . 
yes . they will be much softer and more absorbent if you do , and become nicer with each washing . they bleach beautifully . 
i did not look . i will now.. it states bangladesh ... . they are awesome.. i have had them for several months now.. i bought several sets.. they get wet and dirty fast , so having several make it nice.. 
i am not sure about that because i have never used flour sack towels before , but i can tell you that if you follow the care instructions , they are the best kitchen towels i have ever had . they are absorbent and they take to being bleached really well . i bought this set and then purchased the bigger version . hope this helps . 
we bought two lindy 's stainless steel pans each at a different time . the first one we bought is wonderful , heavy stainless steel . unfortunately , the second one we bought because we liked the first one so much is lighter weight and has and inside recessed groove around the perimeter of the inside bottom of the pan ... it is not as nice not as useful because of the ridge . 
the metal is quite thin . 
the inside dimensions are : 10 1 8 '' wide x 15 '' long . outside dimensions are 12 '' x 16 5 8 '' . it is a heavy , good quality pan . 
it has n't for me . 
no . 
yes , it 's just a slab of stainless steel . 
when the top is extended , it is 24 3 4 '' in height . 
walmart.com has more pictures 
it is a black but more with a little bit of a wood grain . not a matte black finish nor is it shiny . 
no not wide enough 
the actual dimensions for storage are slightly less than the table top 
no , it does not have wheels . 
eco bags are designed to seal with clear packing tape . we do n't include this tape and most people have a roll in their home which saves you a few dollars on our award winning mattress cover ! 
hi brian ! thanks for the great question ! yes you sure can ! we make the toughest , greenest eco mattress protection on the plant . when you unpack the mattress , please lay the bag flat and then fold it like a large sheet . we also have over 20 alternative uses for the eco mattress bag that i have listed below . please let me know if you have any more questions ! do n't stress about your mattress , we 've got you covered ! ! 20 alternative uses for the eco mattress bag 1 . ) instant home repair drop cloth 2 . ) painting or sanding drop cloth 3 . ) protective covering for interior and exterior remodeling 4 . ) garage dust cover 5 . ) patio table and chair cover 6 . ) wind and cold protection for plants , trees and gardens 7 . ) roof cover to stop leaks 8 . ) window cover to protect after glass breakage 9 . ) truck bed liner for hauling dirt , gravel , plant materials 10 . ) car trunk protective liner 11 . ) craft table cover to prevent messes 12 . ) luggage storage cover with protection from insects 13 . ) furniture storage cover with protection from insects 14 . ) car dust cover 15 . ) boat dust cover 16 . ) wind and heavy rain protection 17 . ) temporary cover 18 . ) garage and room divider 19 . ) instant paint spray booth 20 . ) squirrel herding aid ( kidding ) 21 . ) body bag ( okay , now totally kidding . we 'll stop now-but you get the idea . these covers work for just about everything . ) 
yes ! ! 
no . it 's just a duvet cover , two shams , bed skirt and three decorative pillows . 
yes ! it feels similar to flat fitted bed sheets . 
i have 2 dogs . they have hair not fur but it still gets all over the house . i let them lay on my bed sometimes and the hair does n't seem to cling to it at all . 
approx . 93 1 2 `` x 114 1 2 '' ( excluding fringe ) . fits our queen size mattress fine . 
i think it does . i 'm a dog sitter thus must have washable bedding that holds up well through dogs & frequent washing . so far so good . stains come out well ! 
yes , they 're sold separately . i did n't buy the shames only the spread . i love the spread . 
yes , it is a soft bedspread , and very nice looking , has a good nap to it . but remember , if you buy the shams , they are sold separately , not as a set 
i got mine on amazon also . but they are sold in singles , not a pair . 
it is not thin . my wife said it is medium . 
i 'd say medium weight . there is the fabric ( i would equate with a good quality muslin ) with the design in chenille . i do n't like a very heavy spread as i get too hot . hope this helps . 
aside from the pusher ( plastic ) and some o rings , this is all metal . i ca n't tell if every piece is steel , but the major pieces appear to be . 
i am not aware of whether or not this works with a hobart meat grinder . i use this with a kitchenaid stand mixer ( attaches to the socket in front ) . 
depends on what ypu are doing ? ? ? 
8 inches 
i 'm not sure what that model is ? we have the basic kitchenaid mixer with the screw down bowl . it works well . fits & attaches easily . the sausage stuffer tubes were ok. took kind of a long time . hope that helps . 
yes , i have a king bed . it does n't hang off the bedside very far ( like the picture shows ) . personally i love huge oversized bedspreads-this is just fit to size . the material is cheap so be careful when you wash it . the material shrinks up a little ... . 
we never measured it , but we believe it is sized as advertised . it fits our standard king size bed well . ( we are not where we can measure it , sorry ) . it is very light , but very warm . we are pleased we bought it . 
yes 
hi , linda , thanks for e-mailing us ! the comforter is only available in the colors french roast ( brown ) , navy , beach grass and titanium . we also have it available in white on a different item listing . let us know if there are any other ways we can help you . have a nice day and holiday season ! cheers , j. lee 
it comes in a box that is as long as the bed is wide , and approximately 1 ft x 1 ft. inside the box the mattress is rolled and compacted and sealed in tough plastic that keeps it that way . after you carefully remove it from the box and remove the plastic , the mattress expands to it 's normal size . i would have it in place in the rv before taking off the plastic , because after it expands it would be tough move around through narrow doors etc . 
i would not buy this item ted . we had it less than a year and it already `` lost '' it 's memory . terrible . i contacted the mfg , supposedly it was is under warrantee ... .never heard back . do not recommend . 
i believe it will fit just fine . with only one inch extra on each side , the memory foam is flexible enough to fit inside of your end tables . mine is slightly long and when the slideout comes in , it pushes the mattress in a couple of inches , but when we open it back up the mattress returns to normal size . i just returned from a three week vacation and slept on this mattress the whole time . it is wonderful . my only regret is i did n't replace the cheap one forest river put in my georgetown sooner . you wo n't regret buying one . 
it was a little firm so i added a 3 in topper from costco . i like a real soft mattress tho . 
what are the terms ? 
this mattress is harder than spherical trigonometry , but you will get used to it . so hard a cat ca n't scratch it . harder than a wedding p*ck*r. ( buy a vowel ... ) harry 
nope . but anything above that . 
yes , it sits up a bit , but i use it every day ! 
per able brewing website the brewing system is made in usa . i purchased the kone coffee filter . great filter - `` is a stainless steel reusable filter which allows for more oils and a fuller bodied cup of coffee than paper . designed to create the best coffee possible for those seeking a sustainable alternative to paper filters . features : fits kone brewing system fits standard 6,8 and 10 cup chemex coffee makers stainless steel photo etched filter media food safe plastic structure support ring flat cone tip for safety 100 % made in usa by able brewing '' 
no , it is a metal seam . 
could n't find an answer on the net , sent able an inquiry - if they respond with the answer i will post it . 
i have no idea what that is . it 's a similar in size to a number four cone coffee filter . it 's not the same size but if you have one of those in your house it 's a decent comparison . 
5 1 8 inch outer edge to outer edge of the black plastic rim 
yes , you can rotate the tops of the hangers . 
yes . and a much better price 
i have gotten a lot of these hangers . but they are all the same and the amazon basics are a great deal . i bought them recently and will get these again when i need more . 
oh my gosh , are they space saving ! love these so much i got rid of all my other hangers . 
about 16 1 2 inches from end to end . 
yes 
i do n't know , but every morning we juice at least six oranges or grapefruits and it 's just strong as ever . does not heat up . now , i do n't kniow about commercial use , but for normal family use , this is the best . so easy to operate and to clean . hope that helps . 
very easy to clean the epica citrus juicer . this is the most well thoughjt out juicer i have ever seen . it is well sealed where it should be with no nooks and crannys for the pulp to get stuck in . very few moving parts and the ones there are come out easily and are easy to clean . the basket itself will catch some pulp , as will any strainer basket , but if you just run it under water upside down , it 's easy to clean . what impressed me most about this unit was really the build quality . it 's a quality piece of equipment , well designed and well constructed and it just looks really good . i ca n't recommend this juicer highly enough . 
it is a very thick plastic , very sturdy . 
it 's tolerably quiet , it 's not a whisper quiet but i do n't find it as loud as my coffee grinder . all in all it 's a very good buy . 
not if you want to connect it to 120 volt after the round in the dishwasher . 
it 's does n't clog easily ! i love this juicer ! 
good sturdy plastic . very happy with it . 
heavy plastic 
about 6-7oz 
i have n't tried vinegar bases solutions . it might keep the sprayer from clogging though . i have found the sprayer to clog with repeated use of olive oil . 
crystal clear odor resistant bpa free , tritan . it is a copolysester , it is a new plastic or ingredient in the plastic , it is not glass 
yes , the bags can be removed . they hang on the frame with metal supports that are removable . this is good so you can launder them when they need it . 
no i do n't think that would be a problem , you can always turn the wheel so that the lock is toward the inside of the cart ... . 
they should be machine washable , they are made of canvas material , so they should wash alright . i would use a gentle cycle on the washing machine . 
the frame itself measured from the top is about 30-3 4 '' . with wheels turned out it is about 34-1 2 '' but wheels can be turned toward the inside to save space . the bottom frame with wheels turned inward is more like 31 '' with the adjustment for wheel attachment . hope this helps if space is at a premium . 
no - it does n't fold . 
according to the user manual , 1 year limited warranty . 
if you submitted the manufacturers warranty contact them directly or contact amazon customer service . 
so far any k-cup i 've purchased in the grocery store has worked . i 've had hot chocolate , cappachino , apple cider , iced sweet tea . hope this helps . 
i use the reusable `` my k-cup '' coffee filter by keurig and yuban dark coffee . i like a good strong cup of coffee as well . since this has the 6,8 or 10 ounce cup coffee choice , you can try them all to make the best taste as to how strong you like it . i think i made the best choice in coffee makers as it fits my moods . sometimes , in the afternoon , i will make a cup and only want 6 or 8 oz cup of coffee . i love that it has options ! 
the kg6 has no `` twin '' made by keurig . mr. coffee has a licensing agreement with keurig to use the same brew technology , but the two companies do not share any machine designs . any re-usable k-cup filters that work in the keurig units ( but not the new 2.0 models ! ) will work in the mr. coffee units as both companies use the same k-cup extraction design . 
yes , as long as you buy the little filters to go in it . we love ours and i drink regular coffee sometimes . 
really ? 
not at the moment , but we may offer them in spanish in the future . 
not quite sure what you 're asking , but i will answer what i think . my wife did n't want me to put book cases on the sides . we have one of those ladder shelves on one side with `` stuff '' on it . the other side has a small chair . it looks great in the room and she 's very happy . 
hi rodney ... . the distant from floor to handle is 40 inches . the basket dimensions are : height 24 , 18 wide , 22 deep and the extra basket is 18x16x7 . i have found it very useful and strong , but with the four wheels it is almost impossible to actually fold and store . no problem without front wheels though . they are easy to take off and put on . it is very light once it is assembled . good luck ! 
i have put three cat litter bags in weighing 40 lbs each and have not had a problem transporting , hope this helps ! 
a very hard plastic . this cart is great 
just mattress and box spring . i think there are better mattresses out there for a comparable price . 
i do n't have any idea if this is a firm set or not because this was a gift for my daughter and i have n't tried the bed on personally ( she lives in new orleans and i live in new york ) . i will say that my daughter says the bed is fantastic , so i hope this helps you -- -- please stop sending me these e-mails . 
came with 2 bags . the bags are the heap filter i believe . great vacuum ! i love it . 
i do n't see why not ? 
10 amp 
it is about 9 feet 8 inches give or take an inch . very long ! 
it does 
actually , the motor in this unit is more powerful than the vitamix . i think only company that has more powerful motor is blendtec . but you 'll be shelling out at least $ 300 more . and this unit goes up to 24000 rpm which is same as blendtec . same speed ... think ... 
from what i have read , it only has lead in the paint on the box it comes in and the plug . 
just contacted euro-pro ninja product manufacturer to ask about lead claims in their products . i mentioned what i had read so far on the web about the claims and brought up the severity of making false claims about a product for more sales and more money . they responded the following : `` andrea : hi , my name is andrea . how may i help you ? andrea : hello , how may i help you ? andrea : may i help you today ? andrea : is there anything i can do for you today ? ian : hi andrea , i have been shopping around for a blender and noticed the ninja dual stage blender with cups bl-810 ( bl-830 ) ... . looks very interesting . i have on the other hand noticed a growing concern on the web by consumers about the machine containing lead . i would like to have a written confirmation that there is no lead , and if it does contain lead , where lead can be found in the machine ? is the lead in contact with food ? vitamix and other people claim that there is lead on the blade ... . there is a serious legal issue related to false claims ... andrea : the warning was put on all blender instruction books because of us california proposition 65 which limits the amount of lead in a product to 200 ppm . the power cord used on the product is made from pvc which does use a small amount of lead as a stabilizer . since the addition of this warning in our manual , we have had all power cords tested for compliance with this proposition . we have certified results that this power cord and all other power cords used in our products do meet the requirements of proposition 65 of less than 200 ppm of lead . this is not a hazard to users and the warning can now be removed . ian : so no lead in the container or container blade socket that is in contact with the food ? andrea : no , the lead is only in the cord . '' manufacturers and resellers of competing products should stop making all kinds of claims . in any case , i do n't get what the concern is about as far as making sales go . blendtec , vitamix and ninja products can generate similar results , but you ca n't expect a 250 $ machine to entirely compare to a 600-750 $ machine . what 's the fuss about ! they are totally different markets and customer segments . not everyone has 650 $ to land their blender . yes , a small segment of the market might sway from product to product , but in the end if you are a reasonable and intelligent consumer . you know or can guess that a container blade socket made from pvc can not guaranty the same life span as metal . 
without the food processor attachment from ninjas website , it just liquefies them 
hi , thank you for your message . this blender does not grind nuts and coffee . thank you ! buyhappier 
those items can be purchased from ninjas website directly . you can google the ninja ultima and proceed to the website to purchase . 
i 've never had nor worked with a vitamix but i 've never had a blender that was this easy to clean ! i put a drop of dish washing liquid in it and fill the pitcher half full of water and pop the lid on and buzz it for 10-30 seconds , whatever i 'm in the mood for , and rinse clean . once in a while i run it through the dishwasher , like when i make mayonnaise , just to ensure the greasiness gets washed away really well . 
not without a voltage converter . 
the blender will not grind nuts into powder as there is a lot of oil contained in nuts ; this blender will grind nuts into nut butter ; ie. , peanuts into peanut butter . the blender will also grind coffee beans . if coffee beans are ground too fine , the coffee brewed from such fine ground beans will taste unpleasantly bitter . 
19.5 w x 11.5 d x 27.75 h. just let me add , i love it ! i do n't have a lot of room in my house and it fits perfectly . the sections for trash vs recycles are a luttle small ( approx . 9 x 9 each ) , but easier than having a bigger or multiple trash cans . hope this helped 
dear janina , thank you for your inquiry . the height of cw2018 with the lid open is 36.5 inches ( 92.7 cm ) . best , simplehuman 
the beauty of this can is that it has two lift out bins . no decvider . if you want a bigger container you would want to get a different model . i do n't think they make one big bag that would fit this . 
the can has two liners . one blue for recycling and one black for garbage . you put the bags into the liner so you can pull out the garbage . we also line the black one for garbage but not the blue one . 
yes , the bump bar is rather large , and as long as you are n't extremely tall or short you should be fine . 
yes . very soft . i am very pleased with the product . 
nope , same size . cant really compress . 
it 's the size you see 
like a regular bed if you use shams . it is the usual height . the storage comes from no box spring . 
i purchased my mattress online `` amazon.com '' for me ! 
i 'm not sure about a memory foam mattress , but i would say it depends on the weight of the mattress . i have an adjustable air mattress , and it 's very easy to raise . in order to lower back to flat , you have to raise it all the way to 90 , then it lowers . even with the air mattress i have to make sure i let some air out before it will raise easily to the 90 position , so that it bends with the frame . might be a little tricky with just 1 person , but still wo n't be terribly difficult ! 
yes , 2 of these frames equal a queen size mattress 
yes 
if the mattress is inflated , it takes time but it can be done . put on a clean floor , bunch the skirt to the back , crush the fome with your hand and slide the skirt on , like a trash bag . might take an hour . 
we bought the six inch and it works great . you could buy the eight inch for it to be a bit thicker but probably not necessary . 
this attaches through the standard threaded fitting built into the propane tank . heater is supported by a bracket that attaches to the tank handle . everything is provided with heater , just add tank 
yes . every heat lamp has a wing nut that you loosen to adjust the angle of the lamp . 
no it does n't . great heater though . heats two car garage in no time . 
i got mine for christmas last year after waiting several months . i would assume it is 2013. anyway i love it ... ... . 
yes you can , but it is only the two end heaters . the degree of turning is also only very slight . 
not recommended because of the fact that it has a propane fuel source . great for the deck or anything outdoors 
the size of the mass is 75x75x16mm with 16mm being the stack thickness . that 's not good at all for a 16-inch fan . in fact , that 's not even good for a 9-inch fan . the blades are made of thin pp plastic which are very lightweight and flexible making the motor work less hard . 
hi pat , thank you for your inquiry . the pelonis 16 '' stand fan stands 48 inches tall as measured from the floor to the top the fan when fully extended . the base measures 27 inches by 27 inches . please feel free to contact us with any further questions . best regards , the mobile essentials support team 
the fan cage is metal . that 's part of the reason i selected this one - the plastic ones are bulkier and block part of the air flow . it can be unscrewed to open it for a thorough cleaning . 
a reproduction of the real thing one of our most sought after blanket around these days as featured in sunset magazine and country living ( june 2011 ) ! made of 80 % wool and 20 % nylon measure approximately 60 '' x 80 '' it has a beautiful white embroidered cross inside the red line with a blanket stitch along the edges

no 
yes it comes with both 
they area little on the small side . we bought them for our daughter to take to college and they were just the right size for that . they are great for one to three people , but too small for a larger family . they are great quality . 
yes it should . i put a magnet to the bottom of the pots and it clings so it has no aluminum in it . that 's the easiest way to tell . 
i dont see why not if anything i think it would work better 
yes 
mine say parini cookware 
yes . it is a remarkably good set of cookware for the money ! 
i would n't think so . i sent mine back because of the size . i was n't happy with the top either . 
on the bottom of the container is displayed `` 1.7l 67 oz 1.8 qt '' . i have been looking bpa or bis free containers to hold water out of my berkey filter . this was one on the only containers i could find . glass is too heavy , thus ... ... the search continues . 
i just measured mine and the cooking surface is 12x10 . the dimensions outside to outside including the handles is 16 x 10.5 
yes 
i will let it soak for an hour or so in a little dish liquid and water , then use a nylon or plastic scouring pad to lift any remaining hardened food . 
wooden stand and slicone handle is out of stock thanks . 
no , they are screwed into the frame . 
yes 
it is terribly rock hard . no one in my family liked it . we bought it for our kids gaming room . kids usually could care less but both my kids did not like it . the good thing is that with amazon we were able to return it . 
smaller than average if ur a big person like me but comfortable 
no , is not a sleeper sofa . 
only the cushions have zippers for cleaning . 
yes . they are removable . the only problem is is that you have to build the sofa yourself and these back cushions are really hard to fit inside the case . my cushions are deformed and the couch is uncomfortable . i 've had the sofa ten months . 
the back cushions are a little overstuffed , slouchy and shaped to fit over the side a little bit . the seat cushions are firmer , and completely square . all of them have zippers to remove the foam inside and for washing . the cushions are reversible in the fact that you could turn them over and use the other side , there is no difference , the zippers are on the ends .

buy one of those portable water filter and filter the water that way . then use that to pour into the humidifier tank 
hello adam , i run it with distilled water and do n't use a filter . no white dust . i 've seen some other comments that performance of filters depent on water treatment of local utilities . sometimes filter do n't work at all . 
there 's no filter . depending on usage and water type , cleaning to remove scale may be required every other week to optimize performance . if you live in a hardwater area , its recommended to use distilled water . easy to clean comes with small cleaning brush . if scale becomes difficult to remove with brush you can clean with 1tsp of vinegar ( intruction in booklet ) i have been using our 2 units since dec. 24th and have no signs of scale . we use distilled water .hope this has been helpfull 
according to the manual , no you can not . 
i use this in my bedroom and living room 
exactly what is in the picture is what i received . 
my experience is that they 're all the same 
sorry ! do not ship outside us , thanks 
yes , it is a set of 2 . 
if you scroll further down the page , you 'll find the `` product details '' section -- i pasted the info below for you product details product dimensions : 48 x 18 x 75 inches ; 43.6 pounds shipping weight : 43.6 pounds ( view shipping rates and policies ) 
i think it is chrome plated . it is a great product . we bought it to go in our community assoc . 's clubhouse and it fit the bill perfectly . everyone has been impressed . 
you might want to check with the manufacturer 's customer service department for an answer to your question . 
there is no extra piece on the sides to put a second rod for children 's clothes . however , you could move the shelf up to any position , and suspend an extra rod from the bottom of the shelf . you would need a extra rod , plus 2 brackets ( approximately 1 inch wide by 4 inches long ) to attach and suspend from each end of the shelf . the rod would be attached to the suspended brackets . in other words , you would be duplicating the same type of arrangement as the upper brackets and rod . hope this answers your question . 
6'2 '' long 3'8 '' wide 
yes , but the cushions and the legs are stored inside the body . 
yes ! absolutely ! i use steemeewonder on my portable induction burner . it will boil the water super fast in max 60 seconds ! thank you for the question and your interest . jerry coogan inventor 
hello emma , thank you for the question and your interest . the top `` perfect bun steamer '' tier does have only 4 holes that are strategically located so that the excess steam that converts to condensation ( see above main photo ) from the concave glass lid ( not flat red plastic ) drops back into the water ( not on top of the buns ) . also , because of this design you do n't have to worry about the water evaporating as much because the water that turns to steam is recirculated . jerry coogan inventor 
clare r. - not electric . i mainly use it on the stove-top , which i love . because its not electric , it 's kind of become a `` go-to '' camping piece , and my hubby likes using it when he 's cooking for the bbq & pool days . he 'll stick it right on one of those grill side warmer burners and that seems to work out really well for him . hope this helps ! 
the bottom pot holds 4 quarts but you only need ( half ) 2 quarts of water for perfect steaming of hotdogs in 6 minutes and buns in 3 minutes ! jerry coogan inventor 
no , you do n't need to plug it in . you place it on a heat source like your stove top , either gas or electric , or you can even place it on a bbq grill and use the heat source . that way you can get the water to boil and thus create steam . 
sure there are holes in the top & middle pots . the important thing is that the middle level has a lot of holes to steam all the hotdogs evenly and quickly , while the top level has only a few holes to steam buns on top . this also means you can boil corn or potatoes on the bottom level , while you steam cook veggies or shrimp or hot dogs on the middle level , & steam buns on top . 
hello marie : i have converted $ 50 usd to indian rupees = 3037.45 indian rupees + freight cost you can keep warm or reheat nan bread in the top level . if you are interested , i can contact amazon to ask them how to process your credit card transaction including freight cost to india . thank you for your interest jerry coogan inventor 
it does n't have it 's own heat source . use it on a stove top . 
yes it does . that 's the machine i have . keeps coffee close and ready for action 
no , you ca n't , but is so beautiful by himself ! ! 
nespresso capsules are 1-7 16 diameter at the top ( they nest upsidedown in a depression that is made for their size ) and they are 1-1 4 '' tall . there is also a liner in the drawer ( black flocked plastic ) that can easily be removed . the inside of the drawer measures 10-3 4 '' x 12-7 8 '' with a drawer depth of 1-1 4 '' hope this helps ! 
black powdered coated steel i imagine looking at it . i love the unit 
the matching pillow cases you see in the photo are from a cotton sheet set , which is sold separately . 
i 'm not 100 % sure on how much smaller a full-size bed is from a queen ( that is what my girls share ) , but i can tell you that it covers the queen-size bed just perfectly with no extra hanging over . so for a full-size it would definitely hang over but i 'm not sure if you 'd be able to tuck it in . i hope this helps ! 
no . franco manufacturing co. , inc. , metuchen , nj 08840 made in china . that was on the tag on the blanket . 
it 's a mix ... light purple to hot pink . hope that helps . 
summer weight - fleece 
yes , it will fit . its big 
i bought a carbon `` trim to fit '' filter from lowes and use it along with the permanent filter in this machine ( they both fit , but it 's tight ) . on a monthly basis , i vacuum the permanent filter and change the carbon filter each quarter . 
it 's very quiet . no louder than a very quiet fan . unless i am right next to it , i barely hear it . 
yes , i run mine 24hrs a day . 
we have 2 and they run non-stop . they do a heavy duty job in our bird room . pay attention on replacing and cleaning the filters so your true air will last a long time . 
i do n't know . you are n't supposed to have to replace it . just vacuum it to clean it . 
the air enters the front around the oval plate . it exits on the left through a plastic grill . there is quite a breeze on high , but it is barely detectable on low . we have three on 24 7 , one for a couple of years . 
its two frames connected with two brackets , that should be placed in the middle to hold frames together tightly.. yes frames can be used as two twins or king size.. high off the ground great storage underneath and with a good sturdy mattress box spring not needed 
yes it is , do n't know why they show double . very well made ! i am 330+ pounds , works well ! 
there are holes on this to thread a bolt through to the headboard footboard . i am not sure if it will be too high for your model headboard and foot board . the holes sit 12 3 4 inches from floor level 
innerspring 
yes . 
this mattress should not be flipped since the memory foam comfort layer is on top and the support base is on bottom . however , this mattress should be rotated 180 degrees every few months . 
it 's pretty firm - but it 's memory foam - so you sink in a little . i really like mine , and i generally like a firmer mattress . 
they sent 4 but 2 were damaged 
yes you get 4 of them in the order at that price 
yes it have it a the bottom.thank you vevry much 
hello i love my poster and it is . 23ish by 22 and a half inches . i hope i could help 
uhh . normal poster size . like the ones at walmart 
the spread 2 pillow covers , i like it 
i 'm having trouble with bedspreads being the correct size & have sent several back . i ca n't remember what size i ordered this bedspread in to fit my queen-size bed . the fabric seemed ok but it was too short to cover the pillows so i sent it back . 
yes it is . well made and washes well . 
cotton blend no microfiber . its a nice medium light weight and cleans well 
hi , thanks for your question . according to the information on the kinglinen storefront page , they do not ship to australia . you can view their shipping rates and policies here : 
no 
yes , it does have a 20 year warranty . they have all the warranty information on their website . dreamfoambedding.com 
it 's one mattress but the foam inside is separate so each person can have a different comfort level . it 's awesome ! 
79 x 75 x 11 inches ; 75 pounds same dimensions as a standard king size mattress . 
you 'll definitely need to purchase some sort of foundation . we got a box spring but i think one of the more solid foundations that are made for a memory foam mattress would have been a better choice . 
it can . though there should be something like close to together slats or a piece of plywood as the base directly underneath the mattress . 
yes , all three are of different firmness . 
6 inches high with out lid 
hello yes , the inside is also made of stainless steel . our mugs will keep your drinks warm for an extended period of time , although we should point out that they are not vacuum nor thermos flasks . hope that helps . jessica hall customer service team living concept 
unfortunately i ca n't tell if it 's us made , but the quality is very good . 
do n't know . my jar opening is just under 4 '' , and it wo n't fit it . 
they should be a good fit for a 3.5 '' jar . these sealing rings are 3-3 8 '' in diameter and are able to stretch to that diameter if the jar has a raided ridge that they can slip over . but they are not as stretchable as silicon sealing rings .

i believe it is made in china . although it is very hard to find an answer to this question . the address given is actually a warehouse , not manufacturing . address listed is : 1625 route 211 e. middletown , ny 10941. trademark is : listed for kendal is xiaomin chen of deheng chen , llc , 225 broadway suite 1910 , new york ny 10007 
i had another bowl from my other oven which burned out , and all the parts from the quick wave match it perfectly . the extra spacer , the grills and so on . hope that helps . 
racks ! the one i got broke down on me after 3rd use 
it is a glass bowl 
if you can set it higher then 260 degrees then it 's in fahrenheit mode . if you press the temp button you will see that celsius is set lower then fahrenheit . so when it 's 375 f it 'll be like 190 c. when i first got this i had to toggle back and forth between modes just to make sure i had it right . hope this helps 
in china . but do n't buy it . mine broke about a month after i got it and there is no website or phone number to call . it worked great while i had it . 
i have not open or use it yet . 
perfect medium grey ! not too light and not too dark . love this bed set . 
bed skirt , comforter,2 regular sized pillow shams , 2 square pillow shams , 1 square throw pillow and 1 oblong throw pillow 
just the one main area 
no 
yes 
no . but it is a great little unit . instructions states to cook crepes on setting seven . five works better for us . hope this helps . 
wood is . 
i do n't think i would use it commercially , it 's small compared to the crepe makers i 've seen in restaurants . it works great though ! definitely not `` fast '' if that 's what you 're looking for . 
it depends on the height of the window . the window kit did not help in my case . the lip was not long enough the buldge right after the short lip made it unusable even for an up and down window because of the window ledge so for a side window you will definitely have the same issue . when i try to use it it was so awkward it kept popping out . i had to build some contraption to make useable even then i still have issues . 
110volt 
yes they are , i just got the set today . see my review : ) 
i dont know the quality of those other brands . but i would not think these were high enough quality for that . good luck . 
not much , 3-4 cups , tops , probably less than 4 cups , ours had a bad switch so we sent it back . but the company was great about refunds . so we upgraded to a larger teapot . hope that helps . good company ! 
sorry but i do n't have a catalog . royal albert old country rose is what i look for , on amazon or just google it.. 
no it does n't whistle , but it is very quite compared to the other kettles we had . 
yes 
yes , there is a little plastic piece that tells you where to fill the water to . other than that no other plastic inside kettle . 
the lid is all ceramic . no plastic on the lid . 
yes , good quality . safe for kids . 
hi susan , no popsicle needed -- -just squeeze from the bottom -- -- make your own frozen margarita 's ! ! ! yummy 
no 
no . they 're actually a soft silicone . 
they do n't need to propped upright but i wish they came with a little stand so they 'd freeze evenly . we 've had zero spills when they 're laid on their side with the top on securely . 
currently , like the majority of our competitors , they are being manufactured in china . so far we have n't found a cost effective way to have them made in the usa . however , we are definitely looking for a way to make that happen for our awesome customers ! we would , without a doubt , love that as much as all of you . 
i put them in the dishwasher and they seem fine 
no . they get gobbled up too fast for melting to be a problem . 
i 'm not a kid : ) but i love popscicles - and i would say no to the hands getting too cold . i do usually grab a paper towel but it does n't last long enough for my hands to get cold . 
it 's comfortably firm 
yes . i purchased regular queen sized bedding for this mattress and it fits just fine . 
38x75x10 '' 
it has a fabric cover . however , i use an additional mattress protector to ensure no skin particles , mites , etc . are able to contact the mattress . 
nope 
7 inches on the top , 5 inches on the bottom and 5 inches tall 
yes , it works well 
plastic 
it appears to be non-stick ; once you follow the instructions and use a coating of oil ... ... ... .i have been wondering since it arrived , after washing it several times , removal of some grit is not difficult ... ... so ... ... ... ... ... it appears to be non stick ... ... ... ... .with experience , after a while , sometimes the `` so called '' non stick coating is removed ... ... do n't know the name of the non stick coating . removed ... ..the name of the non stick material i do n't known . 
for as expensive as it was , i thought it was junk . everything stuck to the non stick grill 
no . 120w 
anywhere that has a plug i 'd say ! i use mine inside only and then i have a charcoal grill for outside : ) 
china 
yes but you never know what the true temp is no display just a knob no digital read out to be safe buy a forman grill 
no it does n't come with a cover but fits nicely into most mattress covers . 
i have a queen size bed 
i am sorry , but i purchased the queen size memory foam mattress cover . i do not know the weight . 
the twin xl is for dorm room beds 
thanks for your question , according to the product description , the care instructions are : `` hand wash or dry clean only '' . i hope this helps ! 
the bta720xl bit more toaster is 7.75 inches tall . 
it is warm to the touch , and can be handled by the sides of the toaster with no problems - however , i would not classify it as `` cool to the touch '' after using . 
always perfect . buy it , you wo n't have any regrets . jim 
i imagine 5x5x1 '' , but i have n't tried that size . i use franz bread in it which measures 5wx4hx1 2 '' thick and it does fine . 
not home now , but i 'd guess 15 to 24 inches . definitely 'counter top ' length and no more . 
it 's made in china of course . j . 
looks and feels like stainless steel 
yes . 
would n't hold a shirt or sweatshirt it is 11 12 wide , 15 1 2 long . 
6ish 
i wear a 38f , so one for me . probably 2 if you 're a smaller size . 
yes , it snaps over the hanger which is normal size . very sturdy and i love mine ! 
the outside pockets are 3-3 4 '' wide , 3 '' long . the inside pockets are 4 '' wide , 3 '' long . i use it for my brighton jewelry - watches , sets , individual pieces . it 's perfect ! 
yes . while they are different brands , we 've found that this frame is compatible with these headboard brackets : http : www.amazon.com structures-highrise-headboard-footboard-bracket dp b00bj4vkqy ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1396299952 & sr=8-1 & keywords=highrise+headboard+brackets 
have not put an air matteress on it might puncture the matteress 
that would depend on the width and depth of the space between the headboard & footboard , and from side to side . get those measurements and compare them to the measurements provided in the product description . if you have an existing frame with rails , you may want to consider adding extra slats between the rails to support a foam mattress ( if that 's your intent ) which would eliminate the need for the metal platform . 
17.5mm or approx . 11 16 inch 
hard to say . it might , just . the containers are pretty small and they taper at the top and bottom . 
yes 
yes 
no , it 's very smooth and soft - more like a microfiber . we love it ! 
my dog urinated on this blanket a month after i purchased it . what i did was just wash it by itself in normal detergent in the washer on a delicate setting and then i put it in the dryer by itself also on the delicate setting . i was worried maybe the inside of the blanket would get uneven and warped but it did n't at all - it all stayed in place perfectly fine and the stain came right out . 
it 's a pure bright white . it is just amazing when it 's all together ! people see it and they want one ! ca n't go wrong - whatever color you pick . 
comforter , skirt , 2 shams , 3 pillows 
the bed skirt would be too big for sure . if you do n't mind the comforter blanket touching the floor then it 'd be fine . i have a queen and the comforter blanket hangs roughly 6 inches off both sides of the mattress , so on a full it 'll probably hang lower , maybe to the ground . still beautiful though . 
yes - 2 shams that cover two pillows . 
yes if you have it on the yogurt setting . it may be a few degrees higher than 110 though 
we can get them as a special order item but do not stock them . to arrange for that you would have to contact us direct . 
it is unglazed by design . it is naturally non-stick . 
it is made with organic lead and chemical free clay . 
110f for yogurt . 
about 18 '' -- we sent it back because the hooks it hangs by only work on thin or standard doors , and we had a thicker door . 
17 inches 
i found it to be made well , have n't had any issues . 
how thick ? i have it over a standard door , so it 's hard to say . prob maximum of 2.5 '' . 
i do n't have any measurements but it fits perfectly on the inside of my coat closet door which is a regular standard wooden door . 
yes , they are . they are twice as wide as the ones on the top . they can hold purses or clutches . 
no , the back is cloth 
57 '' 
works better with fondant . 
answer here ... excelente 
yes is to big for cupcake 
i 'm pretty sure they would work well for clay . i love them for fondant texture ... ... which is similar to clay . 
i do n't believe it would but it work just find with fondant 
hi , below the specs : primary color : clear shipping weight ( in pounds ) : 0.2 product in inches ( l x w x h ) : 15.14 x 6.8 x 0.2 any further questions please let me know . best regards , diazbetterdeals 
only a pretty short one . my wife bought me one with it and it was about 1 4 '' too tall . you 've got 4.75 '' of clearance - a mug taller than that wo n't fit . this is a small unit . 
it works better with the pods , because it does n't have the little puncture thing for k-cups we bought a small box of them by mistake and have been just opening the little container and pouring it in and it works . 
no it does not require filter paper . it is a mesh cup . this little coffee maker makes a great strong cup of coffee , better than a keurig . just remember to unplug it after use . i like it because i could make a cup as needed . it looks flimsy but it really work , for the price ; give it a try . 
yes it does come with a reusable basket , and you can also use those cafe cups too 
yes 
the kettle is about 14 '' in diameter , and about 14 '' tall . 
stainless steel normally wo n't work on induction plate since it has no iron bottom core . 
no 
as the other person said , probably but dont need one . when i brew , i just use a sheer curtain which helps act as a sediment filter and makes grain disposal a breeze . 
no , simply stainless steel , no multiple layers or walls , or cores . nice though 
this is a smooth and potentially slippery container with no ridges to help maintain a grip . it is also quite large , so large that a big guy like me ca n't get his hand completely around it . depending on your particular difficulty , it probably wo n't be something that is easy to use with only one hand . even i have to reposition it when i pick it up , and turning it to the proper position to drink takes some manipulation . however , it would probably work well with two hands , one hand to grip and one to operate . i can use it in the car with one hand if i pick it up the correct way . hope this helps . 
yes , it fits well without any problems . 
it 's made in china 
8 '' with the cap on 
16 oz 
if you read the product description , it states two sizes : 16 oz and 20 oz . 
china 
i am reading this directly from the package insert i received with my mug . the lid and any unpainted stainless steel body parts are top-rack dishwasher safe . any painted stainless steel bodies are to be hand washed only . i have a blue mug so it must be hand washed . only the type with no color other than the natural color of stainless steel may be placed in the dishwasher . 
6 and 3 4 '' 
the 20oz will not fit upright under the k75 platinum brewer , even with the bottom drip pan tray removed . the 16oz fits fine though . 
no . it 's metal ! 
the lid is bpa-free plastic . it says so on the contigo website and in the amazon description . 
yes , the mug is completely stainless steel . the mug is not dishwasher safe but a very good mug otherwise . 
absolutely fits car cup holders . these have really held up well for me compared to others i tried 
hard acrylic , not flexible 
i bought a pack of replacement straws at walmart , and they work fine . 
i have only washed mine in the dishwasher and it has worked fine , even after having spoiled milk in it . i suggest putting the straw standing with the silverware so that the water can shoot through it an clean the middle . otherwise i put the cup and lid on the top shelf . 
yes . one for each . 
no , the cup is one solid piece . the only detachable part is ( of course ) the lid . 
arizona 
i 'm sorry . i have a watts system . i do not know what to use for the whirlpool system . 
the label on the unit reads `` made in china '' . 
i am using it in florida and seems to help so far . 
no 
there is a separate button for ion function . 
this unit can help to remove cigarette smoke when paired with its hepa-odorcell filter . we would recommend to purchase these together so you will have the best option to help remove the lingering odor . keep in mind , these units will only work in the space that they are in . we recommend that when you receive your unit , take out the basic filter that comes with the unit and put in the hepa-odorcell and turn the unit on high for a couple of hours to allow max air flow . if you have any further questions , please let us know . thank you for choosing alen as your clean air provider and have a great day . 
it does n't seem very sturdy to sit in , but it is great as a shelf shoe rack . i love mine . 
hello celeste ! the space between the shelves in middle measure about 9.5 '' in height . please feel free to reach out to our customer service department if you have any further questions , monday-friday 8am-4:30pm ( cst ) at ( 888 ) 944-8667 or email us at help @ whitmor.com . have a great day ! 
i think it is very close to the quoted dimensions of 11.5 x 41.8 x 19.3 . 
painting is possible . it has a shine to it so may need sanding . staining would seem tough with the finish . i thought about the same thing but it does look nice as is . 
i just looked on my product but i do n't see a `` made in '' imprint anywhere . unfortunately i do n't still have the box . i will say it is well made , not like a cheap china product . the only issue i have is the same that everyone else seems to have- the black handle will unscrew . i think if i just superglue the screw that it will be ok. but it 's expected since it is a crank . if it helps , my mother who is a baker always asks to use my sifter because she says it reminds her of my grandmother 's . i would buy again 
the diameter is 6 inches & the height is about 6 3 4 inches . 
yeah , it is 
we sell through amazon canada . 
to military addresses , we ship u.s. postal via the lowest-cost method , since we offer free shipping . 
not sure to be honest i bought it as a gift but i know the person using it every single day since christmas time and they in love with it . really recommended 
it is a shipping display box 
i did n't get the cross pillow but it looks good without it . i added sum turquoise pillows to bring more western color to it 
yes there are dark or tan available . 
it can but i think it is out of stock 
no 
bella answered on their website that this steamer is bpa free : http : www.bellahousewares.com countertop-electrics steamers black-food-steamer-13872 
plastic , but it is really good quality . 
hi . thank you so much for contacting . i could not find the dimensions of 2 tiers . but the capacity of both of them combined is 1.25 quarts . if you have any further questions please feel free to ask . regards 
no , not that i can see from the pictures on the outside of the box ... it states on the box , `` removable bowls stack for compact storage '' ... '' includes 5-cup rice bowl , 3.5 liter steaming bowls featuring 8 egg holders each , and lid . 800 watts . `` ... `` two tiers for cooking multiple dishes at once '' ... hope this helps ! 
it is pretty thin and not stiff at all so i do n't see why you could n't use it with a neck pillow . unlike , the tv advertised chillow which gets extremely hard after filling it with water and putting it in the refrigerator or freezer , this one is very soft and flexible . my son absolutely loves it . he will put it in the refrigerator once in awhile to make it really cold but it stays cool by itself for days and days . this is one of the best internet items i have bought in a long time . 
it has the texture and feel of surgical tape . it is a large flat gel ice pack . works great and keeps its cool . 
it lasts through the night- cool for a few hours but never warm . 
i would put a pillow case over it just to be on the safe side . the pillow case would be really big but it would give the pad protection but i was say yes . 
i seriously doubt it . between the thickness of the pad and the fact it is under your pillowcase , i ca n't see this as a problem at all . 
the answer is no ; there is nothing to keep it in place . first , realize that this is n't a `` large '' size , in my opinion , as mentioned in the ad ; the standard pillow is 20 '' x 26 '' , and this item is 11 '' x 22 '' . second , it is n't a casing filled with cooling material and foam as most cooling pillows are -- this has 4 small chambers : two small ones in the center , and two larger ones on the ends . this helps distribute weight so that the weight of your head does not displace all of the cooling material inside the pad . third , if you sleep with an angled slanted pillow , this item can roll slide fold down or off your pillow ; my head keeps mine in place ! ( the one i received does not have a `` rough '' side , or `` non-adhesive backing '' as mentioned in some of the other replies to this question . ) to me , it 's better than not having anything to cool my head at all ... while it may not seem that it helps very much , the proof can be realized if you stop using it ... so it does make a difference ! : ) 
there is no activation needed . when i take my mat out of the refrigerator , i put it under my pillow and the coolness comes up through the pillow . 
i would suggest looking in the booklet that came with it and calling the telephone number tats there and asking them . hope this helps . i am so pleased with my ninja cooker . 
from 250-425 degrees 
yes you can 
no 
i do n't know 
items could be up to 6 inches tall . the drawer itself is 5.75 '' tall , from the bottom of the drawer to the bottom of the top shelf is 6.125 '' . the wasted space below the drawer is about 1 inch high . hope this helps ! 
7 3 4 high , 16 '' depth 10 1 2 wide 
hi scribbler - yes you can . you might notice that the top frame is mesh that extends just past the four legs of the frame so the legs will very nicely fit within the lip of the top frame . additionally , the back to legs have tabs with a pre-drilled hole . the two included self-tapping screws will allow you to fasten the bottom frame to your cabinet - and the top frame to the mesh of the basket frame it will sit on . you can continue to stack these 3 or four high . do keep in mind that what you put in the basket can not be too tall - otherwise it will hit the top frame . the roller glides are really nice . i 'm very happy with our two-pair ( large and small ) we bought . hope this helps . 
whole metal , thank you 
8 inch wide for the basket 
it 's probably not the most ideal location for use , but i do n't see any reason why it would n't work . i ca n't see how the cold or moisture would affect the structure or functionality of this drawer . in fact , now that you 've presented the idea , i must admit i 'm currently standing in front of my fridge considering the possibilities . hmmmm . . . 
cassie , for the inside measurement of the drawer , its width is 8 inches . a full sized or dinner sized paper plate wont fit as they are 9 to 10 inches across . dessert plates are 7 to 8 inches . hope this helps . 
i am about ready to try that myself - it seems like it would work . it is just that with medium on large , there is a bit more stability . 
this model does n't come with a milling blade - i just got it today and ran a few tests , it seems to do just fine with the regular blade . i turned both flax seeds and oatmeal into powder 
i have both . the vitamix is gathering dust . sure it can make soup ... like 1 recipe ( all the other ones require prep work like steam something first , who wants that ) . so for the 99 % of the job , making smoothies , this is 90 % as powerful and will crush ice and frozen foods just like a vitamix . the only downside is size . we almost always use the 1 collossal cup and we fill it up way past the limit line . but it wont ' make as much as a vitamix if you plan on making smoothies for 4 people . but the upside is the speed of cleaning . it actually might be faster and easier to just make 2 smoothies vs cleaning the vitamix . so go get it , if you have n't already . and do n't get the 600 , get the 900 . 
yes , all the cups are universal and work with each other 
i believe you have to get one that is for uk electrical wattage . 
you bet it is worth the money . but keep looking for the lowest price available . 
the nutribullet pro 900 watt has fewer problems than the 600 watt 
yes 
amps x volts equals watts . this blender is approx . 550 watts . 
i use mine to grind almonds and get almond milk as well as grind peanuts to make peanut butter . i should think it could grind rice too . 
yes , made in the usa ! 
56 ounces 
i 've been making , every morning , a celery and apples juice . it makes it really smooth and nice . the other day i pureed a veggies soup , was really crest . but i 've not tried with other raw veggies . anyhow , i think it will do well . it 's quite a powerful machine and quite silent - for a blender . 
no , manual specifically says 120vac only 
no its a very hard plastic 
yes 
my opinion is no , not appropriate ... 
no - you pump the knob on the cover about 10 - 20 times and then after a day you pump more because it does not hold the vacuum . 
there are 4 containers . 2-32oz and 2-16oz with lids ... .i hope this helps 
do yourself a favor and do n't buy these . they will not hold the vacuum seal which is the whole reason i bought them . cuisinart wanted me to pay to send them back with $ 7 so they could send me more of these . what pitiful customer service . they are junk . please do not buy them . 
d , we designed and developed the specifications here in the us and it is manufactured to those high standards in china . each item is shipped to our site here in the us , inspected , packaged , and then sent to amazon fulfillment . don ( co-founder schefs ) 
it has a nice , tight seal and i would say yes , if it is big enough for the size batch you are doing . the size is about 1.5 inches diameter across the top and then sloping in slightly to the bottom which has diameter of 1.25 inches . the height is about 1.5 inches . 
bill - it can hold up to 5 teaspoons - but i do not think that is enough to really flavor a full pitcher of tea . it is designed for a single cup ( including a large mug travel mug ) . 
yes it is stainless steel - 304 grade ( 18 8 ) . the first number,18 , refers to the amount of chromium present and the second represents the amount of nickel . 304 grade can have 18-20 % chromium and 8 % nickel . it is the most common stainless steel used in the food prep kitchen utensil market . hope that helps , don ( co-founder schefs ) 
the tea infuser itself is not magnetic . 
aprox . 2.5 inches 
j. richardson - we have had a few ask this or a similar question - but no feedback yet . if you would like to experiment with it we would be happy to offer you a full refund if it does n't work . thanks , don 
hello suzanne . unfortunately , the weck jars are not tested for oven safe . we do not recommend using the weck jars in the oven . they are wonderful for canning and putting all your spices and coffee and ingredients in as well as fun and creative crafts . hope this helps and answers your question . liquid emporium 
product dimensions : 42 x 15.8 x 7.9 inches ; 15 pounds it was easy to put together . looks good.. serves its purpose . 
yes it supports a 55 '' . recently purchased to support my lg . 
hello there ! this heater has one heating chamber that contains two commercial grade 14 '' wrapped quartz infrared elements . 
dimensions : 21.1 '' ( deep ) x 9.84 '' ( wide ) x 25.4 '' ( tall ) 
i had previously bought the 1500 watt smaller model last year and thought that one was the greatest heater ever . when i saw they had a little larger heater i bought that one this year and am totally amazed at how quick it heats the house up and is whisper quiet . i would highly recommend this heater to anyone in the market looking for a good heater . it heats the house up fast and is n't on constantly like the smaller model . i hope this will help anyone out that is trying to decide which model to buy . as for the brand , it is great , no problems my smaller heater still works fine . the smaller model is great for heating the bedroom up quickly and it does n't run constantly now that we have it in there . 
you can set it at a temperature and it will keep the area you are heating at that temperature . we keep ours at 72 degrees and it is very comfortable . when it reaches 72 degrees it shuts it self off and comes on again when it goes below 72 . 
yes a 3 prong 110vac 
just bought this unit and i ca n't really compare it to the ls-8wqh but the ls-1003hh heats up my tv room space in an instant . 
no way unless you modify the metal . 
the largest hole is 3 inches with two 1 3 4 holes , two 1 1 4 holes and two 1 inch holes . 
actually yes , and it is so full of buckwheat that you can take a bunch out to fill a sports sock to heat that up and place around your neck . you wo n't even miss it from the pillow . you can also do a sports sock this way if you fill it with rice while you wait for the pillow to arrive . hope this helps you . 
hi kenneth , yes , the shipping charge is based on each item ordered . thanks . 
3 '' 
anna , i ca n't answer because we bought this for our icomfort serta king size mattress and do n't know enough about the sleep number mattress . i can tell you that we used it briefly but recently removed it as the platform part is much wider than our mattress and took up too much room , plus it was a shin banger . it 's now boxed , covered and stored in the workshop . 
i do n't think so , we have a standard king which fits just perfect , i think a cali king would hang over 
yes , you do not need a box spring . 
10 inches 
yes it can carry the mattress 
when the handle is pressed to hold the fruit , the machine turns its power on automatically . 
no you can not , the orange , lemon and grapefruit are the only fruits that you can press with this machine . i have this machine for almost 2 years and i use it regularly pressing the citrus fruits and it works awesome . i hope this help . 
85 watts . works great 
we sent it back , not what i wanted 
i always wash it by hand as it cleans up quite easily . i would imagine if you put the parts on the top shelf only it would be alright . 
i have not tried any lines but have juiced some small lemons . the juicer comes with two inserts , small and large . so i do not think it would be an issue . 
yes but broke easily order the cuisinart citrus juicer 
well , i have to make a confession . i wash them on gentle cycle in the washing machine , and air dry them . i have had no problems at all . i wash them with my other dish towels and kitchen rags . i know i 'm supposed to hand wash them , but i , well , you know . so far , i have had no problems washing on gentle cycle . i may be shortening the life of the glove : i 'll update and let you know . but for now , gentle cycle is working beautifully for me . they take no time at all to air dry , and i have used them slightly damp before . they still work ! excellent gloves , and i ca n't recommend them enough ! ! 
have not washed mine yet but this is what i am going to do . i am going to treat them like they were a gentle item i wash , i am going to spray them with fantasic because fantastic takes off everything it is amazing.. i am then going to put them into a pillow case tie it shut and wash them on gentle cycle.. i then am going to air dry them ... or in summer i will lay them out on my patio table to dry in the sun .. god bless 
i have n't experienced it , but i 'd have to equate it to a wet hot pad - will burn and how ! i 'd avoid it . 
there was one of each type of brush included with the unit . you install the brush you would like to use . 
the neato xv-21 comes with a charger base , in fact , all new or refurbished neato robots come with a charging base . hope this helps . 
a little under 4 '' ( probably around 3-7 8 '' ) 
depends on when you run it ... while not in house , pretty darn quiet ; ) take a normal upright vacuum and cut the sound about in half . still fairly noisy , but the point is to have it run while you are gone . we rarely run it while home . 
nmhi 
i do not believe so . you may have to get a newer model for the side brushes . 
sure patricia . i have n't actually made almond milk with it yet , but i put whole almonds in my green drinks and i get a smoothe finish every time . so have fun making your milk my dear . carol . 
i would think it depends what u put in it . my smoothies contain no fat , but then i use fruit and vegetables only . calories again depend totally on you , take into consideration the sweets , adding sugar , but then i do n't have to tell you that . i am sure u can find answers going on the internet much better that i can tall you . 
for grinding coffee and or spices 
hmm , i 'm not sure , but mine personally does n't lean and i use it every day 
milling blade crushes dry ingredients , like seeds , nuts and beans . i use it for flax seed . 
no just 120v . 
i had no success whipping eggwhites have not tried it with cream . my old braun could do both . 
it charges off a 110 outlet works great love it 
our unit says it was made in china . 
kenwood direct 
yes you have to hold the button , but it is in a very convenient position so that you hand is over the button while holding the shaft . very nice product . we put it in our kitchen here at the store and it is wonderful ! ! ! ! karen eurostoves 
yes . this model has a stainless steel wand and its own beaker , whisk , chopper and pure masher attachment . plus the soup xl pan blender - an attachment specially designed for blending soups directly into the saucepan without splashing . 
10 inches 
i think you can always buy bed risers but this bed was high enough to put my roll out plastic storage containers underneath it . 
yes they are . 
my queen mattress fits 
we love it the way it is ... ... the metal is slightly on the rough side ... ... i guess if you spray ! ! painted , it might work . good luck 
no , full size 
it should work for a full mattress . i have a queen , but there 's only a couple inches in difference . 
well , i looked up umilk and it uses the same nespsresso single serve pods , like my u. so it should work . 
no , the pod is too small 
hi there k.k , they are 1 1 8 inches deep , 2 5 8 inches at the top and taper slightly down to 2 1 8 inches at the bottom , hope that helps ! 
straight , they are not big , i wanted big extra large muffin tins , i did n't know to ask for jumbo muffin tins . so these are good but for me the wrong size . 
the purpose of using a silicone mat is one of health . aluminum , when heated , leaches into the food . metals like al have been strongly linked to alzheimers and other diseases . one should not use al cookware , al foil , etc . unless there is a barrier between the al and the food . even when cooking in al foil 'wraps ' , one should put a layer of parchment paper on top of the al foil , folding the parchment around the food and then folding the foil . not a stupid question ; hopefully you do n't think it 's a stupid answer ( coming from a biochemist ) . 
this is a little thin for a trivet . it would get hot on the table below it if you put a real hot pan on it . that being said , i have used it for a trivet by folding it in half and it worked good ! test it first to be safe . i hope that answered it a little bit : ) 
yes it is ! ! and the mat has a very nice thickness and is so supple : ) 
absolutely sarah ! i have used it many times for cheesy breads and it works perfectly ! ! many mats do not go to the temperatures this mat can go to so have fun : ) 
it is 45 x 30 cm or about 17 3 4 x 11 3 4 inches ! 
hello ana ! it depends on the cookie sheet you have ! mine is a little bigger and just comes up and over the sides . most cookie sheets are a little bigger , so they fit perfectly . it does n't matter if it is a little big ! enjoy ! 
this mat is very durable and supple at 1.1mm thick : ) 
it is 2.5 inches at the bottom . getting slightly bigger on the way up . 
yes , it will fit a standard car , boat or truck holder . the product description has further information on other aspects of the mug . thank you for your interest . 
yes 
with the lid affixed , the height of the mug is just under 7 inches , so it 's compact . but it does hold 16 ounces . 
like the overwhelming majority of travel mugs , the top notch stainless steel travel mug is manufactured in china . thanks for your interest . 
cup is 6 1 4 inches tall , so i do n't believe it will fit under most models . 
hello ed k : yes , you can purchase additional o ring gaskets for our mugs . the diamenter of the gaskets are just under three inches and you can purchase them at hardware type stores or online at variety stores . amazon sells a variety of o ring gaskets . we choose this type of closure for our lids because it results in a snug suction fit and does not accidently screw loose with mug use . we recommend that you use the large grips along the siides to hold the mugs securely when in use . thank you so much for your interest in our top notch stainless steel mugs -- flagship collections and feel free to contact us with any additional questions . yes 
ed : i rhink our mug will fit your objectives . our mugs are stainless steel inside and out and that is very easy to clean . furthermore , the interior that holds your liquids , etc is smooth and has no seams . we also use a lid sealing system that means the lid sides are smooth and easy to clean . the o ring gasket is around the outside of the lid so its not in contact with mug contents ( see product images ) . i hope this answers your questions . please feel free to contact us again . 
yes , you can wash them . 
no , there are no dividers inside . 
one bag per shoe might work , but certainly not both shoes and still be able to close . 
no it does not but they stayed closed . i have not had any problems with my bags coming open . 
hi brian ... i would think so but i have not washed mine yet . i am expecting to do so at some point though . hope that helps ! 
yes - high heels , sneakers , danskos , boots , and even knitting . 
each layer holds 12 cupcakes . so this model holds 24 cupcakes 
yes , you can also remove the cupcake holder to carry something else like a pie , so its pretty versatile . 
yes , for traditional cupcakes there is no problem using both layers . i have also used it for mini cupcakes and it hold lots . i love this carrier . 
it possibly could ? it comes with a flat tray for cakes too . 
yes 
yes 
ma'am , i 'm so glad you asked ... i just got off the phone from those fine folks at worksharptools ... they , like their products , are incredible . i never hesitate to call , when i have questions . they 're polite , patient , and thoroughly professional ... to answer your question , they have a special diamond belt kit for the ken onion edition . it includes two belts , a 180 grit , and a 1500 grit . these are what they recommend for sharpening ceramic blades . these belts are available here , at amazon.com , with part # 0002970 , and have a price of $ 25.99 ... i could not be happier with my gear from worksharptools , as they have exceeded my every expectation . quality , efficiency , and adaptability , these devices do it all ... i heartily recommend their tool grinding attachment , # wssak081111 , and their belt grinding attachment , # wsssak0881112 . additionally , the belts that all of the ken onion edition knife and tool sharpener and attachments use , are professional grade ... you wo n't find better , even at twice the price ... hope i 've answered your question ... god bless you and yours ... 
yep - just pop off the angle guide , rotate the belt system forward and you have yourself a handy-dandy tool sharpener . i always check the balance of the blade after grinding to make sure one side is n't heavier than the other . i simply balance the blade from the center and if one side falls , i remove a little more material from that side . it 's a rough gauge , but accurate enough for a mower blade . 
i was able to sharpen my bk9 on the original so i 'm not sure what you were doing wrong . but if the original can do it then so can this . 
i 'd suspect fine . i 've done plenty of small paring knives . you may not be able to use the roller knife guide but with practice and a steady hand you should n't have any trouble at all . 
yes . you will need to buy the wskts diamond belt kit . it fits both the original knife sharpener and the ken onion edition . it is 1 2 inch in width instead of 3 4 inch but will work just fine . i have it and sharpen our ceramic knives . 
behind a small flip-up cover about half-way up the left side of the unit when you are facing it . it is set back a few inches from the front of the unit . 
i found it very easy . i just turned off the unit , slid the bucket out , emptied it , and slid it back in . but as i was doing that once or twice a day , i opted to move the unit up onto a stool and attached a short piece of hose ( 4 ft ) that emptied into a small plastic 20-gal trash can . that extends the dump time to 3 days ! 
it turns off ! also , it has a 2 hour and a 4 hour setting : ) 
it has n't so far . i expect it is a safety feature . 
no , but you can hook a hose up to it for continuous drain and feed the hose into the drain and this will eliminate the emptying bucket . 
yes , as long as it has a 3 prong plug which includes a ground . 
pull out the compartment in the front of the unit that holds the water . when its completely out of the machine look inside at the top and there is a pull tab that you pull down and that is the filter . just pull it out clean it and slide it back in . 
dont see why not . i freeze coffee in em 
i use mine to freeze stocks regularly . while the stocks are not as acidic as tomato sauce , i would n't hesitate to use them for that purpose . 
it 's actually pretty hard to simply pop out because the ice cubes are so thick . i had to flip it upside down and melt it a little with water first and then push the ice cubes out individually . 
the top is obviously 90 's but the inside corners are beveled . these cubes are great . you can get three or four short cocktails from one cube . they last forever ! 
yes they stack well . open easy 
not sure exactly . but it is n't much longer than regular cubes . 
china 
as stated in the description , yes . i returned these as i found them difficult on all levels . according to the reviews , i must be alone . 
4.4 fluid oz . per cube , they are 2 '' x 2 '' x 2 '' . they fit nicely in a lowball glass . 
i purchased a king duvet cover for my california king bed & i 've had no issue with it . in fact , the quality was great & we love it . 
the cover is 108x98 
this air conditioner is relatively lite at around 42 pounds , now ! the one thing you absolutely will want to do is to make sure you support the top rail of the unit with 3 screws that screw into your window and also , make 100 % sure that you secure the unit with the window locks provided with the unit , otherwise someone could slide the accordian flaps aside , and possibly remove your unit from your window . rebecca , i 'm pretty much blind except i can see a little light , and i pretty much had it installed in about 10 15 minutes . just take your time , and read your instructions for the install , and you should be fine , also the unit does n't stick out of the window that muchso you should n't need an extra support , however , if your window cill is in a newer home , there is that possibility that you may need a bracket to support it from the outside , , first though , see if the unit fits into the track of your window , and then , slide your window down over top of the unit and proceed to screw the top rail to the window that you just slid down . the first thing you will want to do as you unbox your unit is to assemble the top rail with the 4 screws provided to your air conditioner ok ? i hope my info helped you in your decision , and , if i can be of any more assistance , by all means , please feel free to write me at : raydeman @ comcast.net . thank you rebecca , and i hope you have a good summer .

not without taking the unit apart and voiding the warranty . 
4 inchs 
yes , one year 
you need to grease the bottom . do n't think its non stick , even they say it is . like the frying pan and the egg . it will stick if not coated . 
yes , it warms very well 
when the box was delivered all three bowls were stacked inside the other with the lids on top . 
these bowls are not dishwasher safe . 
no is not water tight 
they come off with a determined child . i would n't trust them . 
no you can not the outside is plastic and the inside is metal 
the thermobowl has a very good locking lid 
the color is as shown on picture . 
12 volt . 
yes , clean cat litter well 
the battery is internal , i 've never seen it . it comes with the charger , that the stick vac rests in . i 'm still thrilled with my vac . 
great appliance on carpet-tile and wood floors-zero scratching ! 
it must be propped up and only on a rough surface like a carpet , not on a tile floor . 
yes . it does come with a charging stand but mine stopped charging after 40 days and the seller refused to replace it saying it 's out of 30 day return policy and asked to contact the manufacturer instead . i wanted one immediately so ended up buying a shark stick vac from a local store . 
i 'm a college student living in a dorm room so it 's enough for cleanly go through the whole room . never tried a greater space though . 
the back of the upright handle will be approx . 12 '' off the floor before the brush head starts to lift off the floor . this unit , as a whole , works best on bare floors . hope that answers your question ! 
i have never seen anyone dry clean bedding . if your front loading washer is large enough , just use that .
